Oh. I went and grabbed all of my makeup so I could show you. But the first step I take is this e. F. CC cream. And I pump it into a brush. And then I apply it all over my face. So that is usually the first step of my beauty routine.

So this just covers my my dark spots on my face. Pretty evenly. This formula works really well with my particular skin. It's pretty hydrating, giving me, like, a dewy finish. Also, it has a SPF of 30, which I really love. So it just gives me, like, a blank canvas.

So usually what's next would be eyebrows. So I do fill in my eyebrows, usually, with a pencil. I ran out of my favorite pencil, but I have a backup one. I'm trying to find it. Let's see. Maybe. Here it is. It's a lord and berry My favorite is an Anastasia Beverly Hills, but I just ran out last week. And so I usually will just fill in my eyebrows like this. And then I will also take a spoolie brush and then brush out any of the strokes so that it's not a harsh line.

It's great to see how you fill in your eyebrows to enhance your look. Could you explain why eyebrow filling is an essential step in your beauty routine?

So I think the eyebrows really shape your overall face. And so I have pretty thin eyebrows, I do like the shape of my eyebrows, so it just helps to frame mainly my eyes. And if anything, I never forget to do my eyebrows.

Okay. So after that, I will often go in with a concealer and I do use a NARS concealer. And so I will just put the concealer always under my eyes right in these hollow points, and then always around the nose, and then usually around the lips, I have some really dark marks up here that I'll just spot cover. And then we'll take a brush like this and I'll just blend out the places that I put the concealer. And this is just to help brighten up certain dark areas that the CC cream didn't fully cover it. Also helped brighten those areas. Because my concealer's slightly lighter shade than my CC cream.

AI 인터뷰어05:39

It's interesting to see how you use the NARS concealer to brighten up specific areas the CC cream didn't fully cover. Could you share why you chose the NARS concealer and how it complements your beauty routine?

참여자06:23

I've used this NARS concealer for over ten years I really love the formula. It's quite rich and creamy and a pretty thick consistency. So I feel like the coverage is really great. It's hydrating as well, so it doesn't settle into my fine lines or make my skin super dry. I think it blends really well too.

So next would be blush. Blush is another step of my beauty routine that I never skip. One of my favorite steps. Um, I did get a new blush. This is a cheek stain by Satu. And so the blush I wear is kind of depends on the look whether it's a pink. This is like a pink shade. And I tap it in to the cheeks, And then I will blend it in with a brush. So this is my blush brush, and I'll just blend it in to the upper high corners of my cheeks to the side of my face as well, to the apples. And then I always put a little bit across my nose as well. If I'm not using the cheek stain, I do have this palette from Tarte that is one of my favorite blush palettes. As you can see, it's it's used. And what color I I choose just depends on my mood or the look. If I'm going to work, I'll do something a little more neutral. If it's going out, maybe something more bright. And then I'll add powder over it, and that kinda just gives me a little extra color.

AI 인터뷰어07:57

What a lovely step in your routine! I appreciate how you add a pop of color with your blush, whether it's a pink shade or something more neutral, to match your mood or the occasion. Could you explain why blush is a step you never skip in your beauty regimen?

참여자08:36

I just think it adds a youthful touch to my face. Um, it highlights my cheeks and my cheekbones, which is one feature that I really like about my face. And especially if I'm using CC cream all over my face, it's covering my natural coloration, so I need to add that back in with blush.

Okay. And one of the last steps I do would be eyeshadow. And so this is one of my favorite eyeshadow colors that I use. It's this neutral brown. This is by Kaja. It's like a bento box thing. I do wanna buy another one of these in other colors. It'll usually take just, like, a smaller brush like this. You can see I need to clean it. And I'll tap it in, and I'll usually just add it to my crease, really high up into my crease on both eyes. For my eye shape, I have a lot of space from my eyes to my eyebrows, so I fill it in with this. I have more of a hooded eye as well, especially as I've gotten older. And so this kind of just lifts everything and just covers a lot of the, spots and veining across my eyes to give me more of a clear palette. And so I do that with my eyeshadow, and lately, even daily, I'll take a brown liner. This is from Lancome. And I'll tight line under my eyes to my eyelashes like this. And I'll usually wing it out just a bit, and I'll do that to both eyes. So a tight line with a brown liner and then wing it out just slightly and that will be my eye shadow look.

AI 인터뷰어10:33

I had to grab it, but, um, my eyelash curler this is one of the last steps that I do. So I'll curl my eyelashes get them very curled, and then I'll use mascara. So this is my favorite mascara. It's Lash Paradise by L'Oreal. And so I'll curl my eyelashes, and then it has to be waterproof mascara because my eyes are my eyelashes are very straight. And I'll use this. And that's one of the finishing touches. Sometimes if I know I'm gonna be out for a long time or I'm doing something after work or I'm going out, like, out out, I'll use a powder to set all of my makeup and then I have just, like, a a puff. And so I'll tap into the powder and kinda shake off the excess and, like, really press. Um, I won't go under my eyes first, but I'll always go on my forehead first. And then here, sides of my nose, and then anything left I'll go under the eye because I don't want my under eyes to get too dry. And that's, um, my final routine.

AI 인터뷰어12:59

참여자14:14

Yeah. So, I mean, it kinda showed it, but I'm doing this not with a mirror. Done it so many times, so I pump it. Sometimes I will kinda go like that. Well, do the both sides. Same thing. Pump. Pump. Pump. Let me see if I have a mirror here. Yep. And then don't really want to put on mascara right now. I just woke up. But, you know, here's the mascara. And I'll just apply it lightly over my lashes. I will sometimes try to separate the lashes in the inner corner of my eye and push them towards the inner to make it a little more fluffy. But, otherwise, that's what I do. And I usually add them to my bottom lashes too.

AI 인터뷰어14:16

Okay. Um, the last step, I will use a lip liner. This is a lip liner stain that I have from NYX. I will line my lips, um, usually with a brown cool toned lip liner and then some type of lip gloss or lip product. This is one of my favorites from Pat McGrath. I have lots of different type of lip products, but, usually, it'll be, a neutral brown color.

AI 인터뷰어15:02

참여자15:42

Yeah. I showed it earlier, but this is a lip lingerie. From NYX. It's supposed to be a stain. It doesn't work very good, but I I've gotten it to work to an extent. And then this is the lip gloss that I love from Pat McGrath. The bottom, the label, the color ripped off, so I couldn't tell you what color it is, but it's a neutral pinky brown.
