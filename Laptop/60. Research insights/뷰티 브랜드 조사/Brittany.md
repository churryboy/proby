So by putting on the concealer, it helps cover up those flaws that I have and make me feel more beautiful and confident.

So sometimes I will put on also foundation. Um, however, I find that foundation can get really cakey, and it looks unnatural. And it feels like it's clogging up my pores, and it's not breathable. So that's why that's not part of my everyday routine. Um, after I use the concealer, then I will use a blush, like, from the brand Ilmakiage. And I will, um, apply this on my cheeks.

So after I'm complete with my whole makeup look, and those are the main products that I use all the time. There are other products here and there. I like to switch it off. Like, I might use, um, for example, this NYX eye pencil instead or this, brow setter from benefits. But other than those products, I will apply at the end this three second setting spray from L'Oreal, and this is to help keep my makeup in place so it lasts longer and hopefully doesn't smear and fade, and I can feel good throughout the day without having to constantly retouch my makeup.

Yeah. So that completes my makeup look. There are some times where I find that I do have to do touch ups to my makeup or I might change it up. I might want a little bit more of a dramatic So I'll focus even more in my eyes and add, um, eyeshadow, for example. Or sometimes I do put foundation. Um, but as I said before, I do worry about the cakiness of it. Um, but that mostly completes my root other than I also use products for my skincare routine, many different products. As well as my hair care routine too, like, I will put, um, this 10 in one spray to keep my hair from being a frizzy mess. Throughout the day, or I'll put in a serum too to help hydrate it and make it smoother and shinier. Um, but those are the most of the makeup products that complete my beauty routine.

It's fascinating to hear about your makeup routine and how you adjust it based on your preferences. Could you share more about the specific eyeshadow or foundation products you use and how you manage concerns like cakiness?

참여자13:39

Yeah. Sure. So one of the eye show products that I use is from CoverGirl. I like their clean eyeshadow because it's free of certain ingredients that I'm concerned about could be harmful. I am trying to use more natural products, so I'd like my makeup routine overall to be more natural, but easier said than done. And, um, my eyeshadow, far as addressing the concerns that I have, I feel like I'll look for one that just glides more effortlessly, and I can really smooth it out. I'll use a brush or a beauty blender, different tools that can help with that. Also, when it comes to my foundation, I will use CoverGirl or Clinique. Um, I've also used Maybelline as well. And I'll just try to blend it in really well. I'm still on that lookout for that perfect foundation. It can be difficult to get it where it looks really and isn't cakey and matches my shade completely. Um, that's been difficult for me to find, which is why I don't always use foundation even though I should to cover some of my flaws and blemishes that I have. But, um, usually, it's just a lot of trial and error to figure out what's works best for me.
