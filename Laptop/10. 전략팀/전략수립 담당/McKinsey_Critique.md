# McKinsey Strategic Critique: Proby Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

This strategy document presents an AI-powered qualitative research platform targeting in-house researchers. While the core value proposition is compelling, the strategy suffers from critical gaps in market sizing, competitive analysis, and go-to-market execution. The document requires substantial strengthening before it can serve as an actionable strategic roadmap.

**Overall Assessment: 5.5/10**

---

## Key Strengths

### 1. Clear Value Proposition
The positioning as a "moderated survey platform with overwhelming ROI" is well-articulated. The cost comparison table effectively demonstrates a 5-10x cost advantage over traditional qualitative research methods.

### 2. Customer Segmentation Logic
The rationale for focusing on in-house teams over agencies is sound, particularly points #1 (problem ownership) and #4 (power dynamics limiting agency innovation).

### 3. Product-Market Fit Hypothesis
The identification of moderation as a manual, inefficient process where AI can create step-change value is strategically astute.

## Critical Weaknesses

### 1. **Insufficient Market Sizing (CRITICAL)**

**Issue:** No quantifiable market size, TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, or revenue potential.

**Questions left unanswered:**
- How many in-house researchers exist in Korea? Globally?
- What is the total addressable market for qualitative research?
- What percentage of that market is accessible to Proby given current capabilities?
- What is the realistic penetration rate by year 2-3-5?

**Recommendation:** Conduct rigorous bottom-up and top-down market sizing. Estimate:
- Total in-house researchers by company size (startup/unicorn/enterprise)
- Average research budget per company
- Research frequency and typical project size
- Share of wallet opportunity

**Expected output:** "$X billion TAM, $Y million SAM, targeting $Z million revenue by Year 3"

---

### 2. **Weak Competitive Analysis (CRITICAL)**

**Issue:** No mention of competitors, alternatives, or competitive moats.

**Missing elements:**
- Who are the direct competitors? (UserTesting, Remesh, Upsiide, Discuss.io, etc.)
- What about indirect competition? (traditional agencies, DIY tools like Dovetail + human moderators)
- What prevents incumbents from adding AI moderation?
- What are Proby's defensible moats beyond first-mover advantage?

**Strategic risk:** Without understanding competitive dynamics, you cannot:
- Price effectively
- Differentiate meaningfully
- Anticipate competitive responses
- Build sustainable advantages

**Recommendation:** Complete a comprehensive competitive landscape:
- Map 10-15 players across dimensions (price, features, target segment)
- Identify white space opportunities
- Define 3-5 year competitive moats (technology, network effects, data advantages)

---

### 3. **Vague Go-to-Market Strategy**

**Issue:** The "market entry strategy" section is mentioned but not detailed in the document.

**Critical gaps:**
- Customer acquisition channels (how do you reach researchers?)
- Sales motion (PLG vs. enterprise sales vs. hybrid?)
- Pricing model (per-project? Subscription? Usage-based?)
- Pilot/POC strategy
- Customer success and retention approach

**Recommendation:** Develop a detailed GTM playbook including:
- Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Pilot with 10-15 design partners
- Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Refine product, establish case studies
- Phase 3 (Year 2): Scale acquisition via [specific channels]
- Define CAC targets, payback period, and LTV:CAC ratios

---

### 4. **Targeting Strategy Lacks Prioritization**

**Issue:** Three distinct customer segments (startup PM/PDs, unicorn researchers, enterprise researchers) with different needs, but no prioritization or sequencing.

**Problems:**
- Spreading resources thin across multiple segments
- Different segments require different sales motions and product features
- No clear "beachhead" strategy

**Recommendation:** Apply the McKinsey beachhead framework:
1. **Beachhead (Year 1):** Focus exclusively on unicorn companies needing international research
   - Why: Highest willingness to pay + acute pain point + referenceable
   - Target: 50 unicorn researchers, 5-10 pilot customers
2. **Expansion (Year 2):** Move upmarket to enterprise researchers
3. **Scale (Year 3):** Democratize to startup PM/PDs with self-serve model

This creates a logical progression from high-touch to product-led growth.

---

### 5. **Unvalidated Assumptions (HIGH RISK)**

The strategy rests on several untested hypotheses:

**Assumption 1:** "AI moderation quality matches human moderators"
- **Risk:** If quality is subpar, researchers won't trust it for important studies
- **Mitigation needed:** Blind testing with professional moderators, publish validation studies

**Assumption 2:** "Researchers are willing to adopt self-serve AI tools"
- **Risk:** Research culture is conservative; many prefer full-service
- **Mitigation needed:** User research with 20-30 target customers on adoption barriers

**Assumption 3:** "Cost savings alone drive adoption"
- **Risk:** Quality and trust may matter more than price for high-stakes research
- **Mitigation needed:** Value proposition testing beyond cost

**Assumption 4:** "In-house teams have budget authority"
- **Risk:** Budget may be centralized; procurement processes complex
- **Mitigation needed:** Understand buying committees and approval processes

**Recommendation:** Design a 90-day validation sprint to test these hypotheses with 15-20 target customers.

---

### 6. **Missing Financial Model**

**Issue:** No unit economics, revenue projections, or path to profitability.

**Required elements:**
- Customer LTV by segment
- CAC by channel
- Gross margin (accounting for AI compute costs)
- Burn rate and runway
- Break-even analysis

**Recommendation:** Build a 3-year financial model showing:
- Year 1: $X revenue, -$Y EBITDA (investment year)
- Year 2: $3X revenue, -$Y/2 EBITDA (scaling year)
- Year 3: $10X revenue, +$Z EBITDA (profitability)

---

### 7. **Product Strategy Contradictions**

**Issue:** The document crosses out "AI avatar moderator" positioning but this seems core to the value prop.

**Concerns:**
- Is the product vision clear internally?
- What is "Proby" - a brand name? A mascot? The AI moderator itself?
- How does "moderated survey platform" differ from existing survey tools + human analysis?

**Recommendation:** Clarify the product hierarchy:
- Core: AI-powered moderation engine
- Wrapper: End-to-end platform (recruit → moderate → analyze → report)
- Differentiation: What can Proby do that Qualtrics + manual analysis cannot?

---

### 8. **Weak International Strategy**

**Issue:** "Global research capability" is mentioned as a sales point but not elaborated.

**Questions:**
- Which countries/languages are supported?
- How does translation quality compare to human interpreters?
- Are there cultural nuances AI might miss?
- What is the roadmap for language expansion?

**Recommendation:** Define geographic expansion strategy:
- Phase 1: Korea + English-speaking markets
- Phase 2: Add Japan, SEA
- Phase 3: Europe, LatAm
- Justify each phase with market size and readiness

---

## Strategic Blind Spots

### 1. **Regulatory & Ethics**
No mention of:
- Data privacy (GDPR, CCPA compliance)
- AI ethics in research (bias, transparency)
- Industry certification requirements

### 2. **Scalability Constraints**
- What happens to AI costs as usage scales?
- Are there quality degradation risks at scale?
- What are the infrastructure requirements?

### 3. **Ecosystem & Partnerships**
- Should you partner with panel providers?
- Integration with research platforms (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey)?
- Academic/industry validation partnerships?

## Final Assessment

This strategy document provides a reasonable starting point but requires significant development before execution. The core insight—that AI can revolutionize qualitative research moderation—is compelling. However, without rigorous market sizing, competitive analysis, and financial modeling, this remains a hypothesis rather than a strategy.

### Priority Actions (Ranked):
1. **Complete market sizing** (enables investment decisions)
2. **Deep competitive analysis** (defines positioning and moats)
3. **Customer discovery** (validates assumptions)
4. **Build financial model** (ensures viability)
5. **Detail GTM playbook** (enables execution)

### Rating Breakdown:
- Vision & Positioning: 7/10 (clear but needs sharpening)
- Market Analysis: 3/10 (insufficient)
- Competitive Strategy: 2/10 (nearly absent)
- Go-to-Market: 4/10 (directionally correct but vague)
- Financial Viability: 1/10 (not addressed)
- Risk Management: 3/10 (assumptions not tested)

**Overall: 5.5/10** - A promising start that needs substantial analytical rigor before becoming investor-grade or execution-ready.

## Parting Thoughts

The best strategies answer three questions unambiguously:
1. **Where will you play?** (Target market and segments)
2. **How will you win?** (Differentiation and competitive advantage)
3. **What capabilities must you have?** (Resources, partnerships, technology)

This document begins to answer #1 but leaves #2 and #3 largely unaddressed. I'd recommend treating this as a "draft hypothesis" and spending the next 90 days pressure-testing every assumption with real customer conversations, competitive intelligence, and financial modeling.

The opportunity is real, but the path to capturing it needs far more precision.
