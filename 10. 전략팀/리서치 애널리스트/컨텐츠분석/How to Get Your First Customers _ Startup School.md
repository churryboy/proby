## Key insight / summary

- **"Do Things That Don't Scale" 철학**: 초기 스타트업은 자동화된 성장이 아닌 창립자가 직접 고객을 하나씩 확보해야 함 (Paul Graham의 핵심 에세이 기반)
- **창립자가 직접 세일즈해야 하는 이유**: 고객을 깊이 이해하고, 제품 개발 방향을 파악하며, 회사 DNA에 세일즈가 내재화되도록 하기 위함
- **스타트업 커브**: 론칭 → 절망의 골짜기 → 무능의 추락 → 거짓 희망의 흔들림 → 제품-시장 적합성 단계를 거치며, 각 단계에서 창립자의 의지가 성패를 결정
- **가장 쉬운 고객부터 접근**: 초기에는 가장 전환 가능성이 높은 고객에게 집중하여 세일즈 프로세스를 단순화해야 함
- **효과적인 세일즈 이메일 작성법**: 6-8문장 내 간결함, 명확한 언어, 고객 문제 직접 해결, 소셜 프루프 포함, 명확한 CTA 필요
- **세일즈 퍼널의 체계화**: 리스트 작성 → 이메일 발송 → 미팅 스케줄링 → 가격 협의 → 클로징 → 온보딩까지 전 과정 관리
- **제품 개선과 고객 확보의 선순환**: 고객과의 직접 소통을 통해 제품을 개선하고, 개선된 제품으로 더 많은 고객을 확보하는 구조

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **창립자 주도 초기 세일즈 전략**: McKinsey 전략문서에서 언급된 "유니콘 리서처" 타겟을 창립자가 직접 접촉해야 함. Proby 창립자들이 한국 주요 유니콘 기업의 리서처 50명 리스트를 만들고 개인적으로 컨택하여 파일럿 고객 10-15명 확보
- **"Do Things That Don't Scale" 적용**: AI 자동화 플랫폼이지만 초기에는 창립자가 직접 온보딩, 결과 해석, 피드백 수집을 수행하여 제품 개선점 파악. 완전 자동화보다는 하이브리드 서비스로 시작
- **가장 쉬운 세그먼트 우선 공략**: 전략문서의 3개 세그먼트(스타트업 PM, 유니콘 리서처, 엔터프라이즈) 중 "해외 리서치 니즈가 있는 유니콘 리서처"부터 시작 (높은 지불의향 + 명확한 페인포인트)
- **세일즈 이메일 템플릿 개발**: "AI 모더레이션으로 기존 정성조사 대비 1/5 비용, 1/3 시간으로 글로벌 리서치 가능"이라는 명확한 가치 제안을 6-8문장으로 압축한 템플릿 제작
- **온보딩 프로세스 필수화**: 전략문서에서 지적된 "AI 품질에 대한 신뢰 부족" 문제 해결을 위해 초기 고객에게는 창립자가 직접 온보딩하며 기존 휴먼 모더레이터와 블라인드 테스트 결과 공유
- **리텐션 중심의 성장 전략**: 세일즈 퍼널의 마지막 단계인 온보딩과 리텐션에 특히 집중하여 고객이 Proby의 AI 모더레이션 품질을 체감할 수 있도록 지원
- **반복 구매 유도 메커니즘**: 스타트업 커브의 "절망의 골짜기"를 넘기 위해 첫 프로젝트 성공 후 즉시 다음 리서치 니즈 발굴하고 패키지 제안하는 능동적 세일즈 프로세스 구축

- [00:03] [Music]
- [00:10] School my name is Gustav and I'm a group
- [00:13] partner here at y combinator today I'm
- [00:15] going to talk about how to go from
- [00:16] talking to users
- [00:18] getting your first customers here's what
- [00:20] I plan to cover today one what does it
- [00:22] mean to do things that don't scale and
- [00:24] why is this mindset so so important at
- [00:27] this stage of your company two how to do
- [00:30] sales I'll make the argument the founder
- [00:32] should be the ones doing sales in the
- [00:34] beginning then we'll cover some sales
- [00:35] funnel information and then why is it so
- [00:37] important to charge for your product and
- [00:39] finally we'll learn how you work your
- [00:41] way backwards from your goals and why
- [00:43] that's important I hope you've read this
- [00:45] article or this essay the most important
- [00:47] essay ever written about the very early
- [00:49] stage of startups is do things that
- [00:52] don't scale by Paul Graham Paul is the
- [00:54] co-founder of Y commner he published
- [00:56] this essay about the early days of
- [00:58] Airbnb Airbnb is perhaps the best
- [01:00] example of a successful YC company who
- [01:03] got their feet off the ground this way
- [01:05] many Founders who never worked for a
- [01:07] startup or an early stage company
- [01:09] incorrectly believe that all you need to
- [01:12] succeed is a good product and growth
- [01:14] will take care of itself this is not the
- [01:16] case the truth is that good product is
- [01:19] very rarely built in isolation but
- [01:22] together with your customers and as a
- [01:23] result it's not actually that good when
- [01:26] you show it to your first customers set
- [01:28] this another way
- [01:29] startups don't take off by themselves
- [01:31] startup takes off because Founders make
- [01:33] them take off and you have to manually
- [01:35] recruit your customers it's not enough
- [01:37] to push a button on an advertising
- [01:39] Network this is uncomfortable and
- [01:41] Founders continuously find many ways to
- [01:43] avoid doing this the most common way is
- [01:46] believing that you can recruit people by
- [01:48] just writing more code or doing more
- [01:50] work on your machine or your robot or
- [01:52] whatever you're building I know this
- [01:54] from my experience of YC that this
- [01:56] actually don't work so why am I talking
- [01:58] about this right now learning the
- [02:00] tactics of sales is just one side of
- [02:03] this uh of of this learning the most
- [02:06] important side is just really realizing
- [02:09] that it comes down to you it's not just
- [02:11] knowing exactly how to do sales in
- [02:13] theory but actually doing it and
- [02:15] actually wanting to succeed another
- [02:17] great visualization is what's called a
- [02:19] startup curve this was initially drawn
- [02:21] by YC found program and then labeled by
- [02:23] Trevor Blackwell and you've probably
- [02:25] seen this curve before most companies go
- [02:27] through something like this it's kind of
- [02:30] like a timeline for startups here's how
- [02:32] it goes first you launch these days most
- [02:35] companies don't launch on TechCrunch but
- [02:37] probably on product hunt or Hacker News
- [02:39] or some other internet board the launch
- [02:41] energy that you get from this launch
- [02:42] eventually starts wearing off as early
- [02:45] adopters are looking out for something
- [02:46] new if you don't have instant High
- [02:48] retention nobody does for what you are
- [02:51] building then you'll enter the through
- [02:53] of Sorrow this can take a long time and
- [02:56] many companies die during this stage
- [02:57] they just give up and don't move fast
- [03:00] enough with testing new things some
- [03:02] startups do move fast enough and release
- [03:05] new improvements of their product
- [03:06] they'll listen to users and they improve
- [03:08] many still don't get anywhere further
- [03:10] and becomes victims of the crash of
- [03:12] ineptitude it's the founders to stay the
- [03:14] course and don't give up that reaches
- [03:17] the Wiggles of false hope and eventually
- [03:18] the promised land of crack Market fit
- [03:20] the learnings we draw from the start
- [03:21] curve is that every moment in the early
- [03:24] days of startups the founders are the
- [03:26] ones that make the difference between
- [03:28] success and failures if you are in the
- [03:30] wrong Market
- [03:31] it's the founders that switch to a new
- [03:33] one and if you don't know how to do
- [03:35] sales it's the founders who learn so you
- [03:37] have to really want it otherwise this
- [03:39] won't work all right let's talk about
- [03:41] sales and how to do sales first Founders
- [03:44] should learn how to do sales you should
- [03:47] learn how to do sales because you'll
- [03:49] need to learn to know your customer
- [03:50] talking to customers and sales are
- [03:52] effectively different sides of the same
- [03:54] coin and the same reasons Founders can't
- [03:56] understand what to build they don't
- [03:58] understand what the problem is you don't
- [03:59] know how to sell unless you know your
- [04:02] customers two learning how to do sales
- [04:04] actually gives you full control of your
- [04:07] destiny as a startup just like you can't
- [04:09] Outsource engineering sales has to be
- [04:11] part of the DNA of the founders
- [04:13] sometimes you just have to learn it as a
- [04:15] result you should not hire a sales team
- [04:17] until you know how to do sales yourself
- [04:19] only then will you know what good looks
- [04:22] like you also can't do sales if you
- [04:24] practice bad and you won't know if the
- [04:26] product is bad unless you've had some
- [04:28] effort in trying to sell it first if you
- [04:30] don't know how to sell don't worry you
- [04:31] you can learn it's probably the easiest
- [04:33] job to learn in startup if you know the
- [04:35] problem you're solving if you know
- [04:37] you're product intimately if you know
- [04:40] the market you are an expert in the eyes
- [04:42] of the customer they will want to hear
- [04:45] what you have to say finally a love for
- [04:47] solving customer problems is really
- [04:49] infectious if you're really passionate
- [04:52] about solving this problem they will be
- [04:54] able to tell if you don't believe me
- [04:55] here are some examples of Founders who
- [04:57] took on the sales job and learned to get
- [05:00] really good at it so Tony from doordash
- [05:02] matild from front Tracy from plangrid
- [05:05] and Steve Jobs let's get straight into
- [05:07] an example so these are the brex
- [05:09] founders Pedro and henrique when brex
- [05:11] was in wycomner in Winter of 2017 they
- [05:14] recruit the first 10 customers directly
- [05:16] from the YC batch June YC you have the
- [05:19] benefit of being around other startups
- [05:21] I.E potential customers the brex
- [05:22] founders asked themselves what would the
- [05:24] minimum product look like that they can
- [05:26] build to be useful to other startups and
- [05:28] then they went with strain straight into
- [05:30] signing up those customers the first
- [05:32] version was very very simple customers
- [05:34] just had a virtual credit card and
- [05:36] Enrique from brex actively onboarded
- [05:38] everyone of the customers himself of
- [05:40] course they could have waited until they
- [05:42] had a full-blown product a website a
- [05:44] Mobile app all of those things but they
- [05:46] decided to get going when they have
- [05:48] something that was really useful this is
- [05:50] how their first physical card looked
- [05:51] like this before they had this card they
- [05:53] just had a virtual card Rex reached out
- [05:55] to the their YC batch and otherwise the
- [05:58] companies and this is the email that
- [05:59] they sent I'm just going to read a brief
- [06:01] portion of it hey guys we're opening up
- [06:03] our beta for winter 17 batch friends
- [06:05] with the 10 spots for beta users 10 spot
- [06:08] this sounds like there's a limited spot
- [06:10] so I should take actions brex is a
- [06:11] corporate credit card focused on
- [06:13] technology companies that's me perfect
- [06:15] you're actually writing the email
- [06:17] directly towards your customers we don't
- [06:19] require a personal guarantee it can
- [06:21] underwrite startups who just got started
- [06:23] this was the value prop most other
- [06:25] alternatives to brex did not have
- [06:27] something like this so how much does it
- [06:29] cost it's free the merchants are paying
- [06:31] us so there's zero Annual fees this
- [06:33] seems like a no-brainer I would argue
- [06:35] that this email is probably a little bit
- [06:37] too long but it did work so let's talk
- [06:39] about how to write a great sales email
- [06:41] so first it should be short Max 6 to 8
- [06:45] sentences the brexit sample on the
- [06:47] previous slide is probably too long it
- [06:48] still worked but probably too long
- [06:50] people don't have time to read long
- [06:52] emails if you're coming out of Academia
- [06:55] your culture is going to be very
- [06:56] different you write very long emails but
- [06:58] in the world of sales you want to get to
- [07:00] the point and be brief as much as you
- [07:02] can two you want to make sure you have
- [07:04] clear language no jargon no buzzwords
- [07:07] just say exactly what you do and how it
- [07:09] works and then three address the problem
- [07:12] that the potential customer is having
- [07:14] four do not use any HTML formatting
- [07:16] write your email in plain text only like
- [07:18] you would written it to a friend say you
- [07:20] are the founder of the company who makes
- [07:22] this product many people forget to do
- [07:24] this describe why you and your team are
- [07:27] impressive include social proof and
- [07:29] remember to show not tell don't say
- [07:31] you're an expert don't say how many
- [07:33] years that you have been an expert if
- [07:35] you're in the YC match if you worked at
- [07:37] impressive companies in the past those
- [07:38] are other piece of social proof that you
- [07:40] can include you won't include a couple
- [07:42] of these ones so that the reader knows
- [07:45] the source and even if they don't know
- [07:47] you gives assign you some authority six
- [07:49] you want to include a link to your
- [07:51] website the website needs to be simple
- [07:53] you have to have information about the
- [07:56] product the website should not have a
- [07:58] lot of drawings or sort of like paid for
- [08:01] graphics you should just have
- [08:02] screenshots from your product and
- [08:04] bullets about what your product does
- [08:06] sometimes it works to send a short video
- [08:08] a YouTube video that you can embed in
- [08:10] the email that's very easy for the
- [08:11] receiver to click on and View and I've
- [08:14] even seen people using gifs now those
- [08:16] videos and those gifs needs to get to
- [08:18] the point right away because the the
- [08:20] receiver is kind of intimately familiar
- [08:22] with the problem but not really have
- [08:23] time to watch two or three or four
- [08:25] minutes of a potential solution and then
- [08:27] finally you want to include and ask for
- [08:29] a call or a meeting or a self-serve
- [08:31] whether whatever is appropriate for your
- [08:33] company but there needs to be a call to
- [08:35] action in the email that you're sending
- [08:37] all right let's talk about the sales
- [08:38] funnel the concept of sales funnels is
- [08:40] really quite easy I think people get
- [08:42] confused by the language the sales
- [08:44] people are using so I try to simplify it
- [08:46] here on the left hand side I call it the
- [08:48] founder speak on the right hand side I
- [08:51] call it the sales speak these are not
- [08:52] going to be perfectly mapping but you
- [08:54] get the idea so first you want to make a
- [08:57] list of customers you plan to reach out
- [08:59] to in sales it's called prospecting or
- [09:01] lead generation we'll just call it make
- [09:03] it the list and you can use Google
- [09:04] spreadsheets or something like that to
- [09:06] make this list then we want to send them
- [09:08] an email or a LinkedIn message or add
- [09:10] them on LinkedIn or whatever is the
- [09:12] appropriate way to contact these people
- [09:13] after that you want to schedule and run
- [09:15] a demo or a meeting from that response
- [09:18] to the email and then you want to talk
- [09:19] pricing and then finally close them as a
- [09:21] customer the last thing which you should
- [09:22] not forget is after you've closed them
- [09:24] you still need to onboard them to make
- [09:26] sure that they start using your product
- [09:28] if this is successful and you have good
- [09:30] retention that could lead to long-term
- [09:31] Revenue if you forget the last step then
- [09:34] you will have lots of churn because
- [09:35] people don't actually know how to use
- [09:36] your product and this is common with
- [09:38] early products because they are not easy
- [09:40] to onboard in the beginning this is not
- [09:42] something you spend a lot of time
- [09:43] optimizing so make sure that you do the
- [09:45] onboarding as part of this process if
- [09:47] you go back to the Google spreadsheets
- [09:49] that I'm that I'm making that I'm
- [09:51] putting in all the information you
- [09:52] should start simple but you should have
- [09:54] some Columns of things that you're
- [09:56] tracking so industry uh the company the
- [09:59] title the name the email maybe the
- [10:01] LinkedIn this could be enough to start
- [10:03] with a lot of CRM software comes with
- [10:06] these categories so these columns it's
- [10:09] pretty good idea to kind of use a simple
- [10:10] CRM software
- [10:12] um to kind of accomplish the same goal
- [10:14] but the key thing here is doing this
- [10:16] work up front and I've seen a lot of YC
- [10:18] Founders that when they are getting to a
- [10:20] thousand of these they're like oh this
- [10:22] is a very simple task I can actually
- [10:24] Outsource this and I think that can work
- [10:26] if you know exactly what it is you're
- [10:28] Outsourcing storing all this information
- [10:30] is going to be helpful for you in the
- [10:31] future now I made my list I understand
- [10:34] this the sales funnel so who should I be
- [10:37] going after and how should I be
- [10:38] prioritizing as I'm doing the Outreach
- [10:41] here's my most important advice when it
- [10:42] comes to sales your first customers
- [10:44] should be your easiest this is not the
- [10:47] time to bite off the hardest one
- [10:49] focus on the easiest ones what I mean by
- [10:51] that is you should try to do sales
- [10:53] make the sales processes easy for you as
- [10:55] you possibly can startups don't really
- [10:58] have time to chase every lead there's a
- [11:00] lot of leads out there you you don't
- [11:02] have to pick all of them you really
- [11:03] don't you're so early you can pick only
- [11:06] the ones that are the most likely to
- [11:07] close the best way to do this I have a
- [11:09] big pipeline where that means a lot of
- [11:11] people that you're emailing are
- [11:13] potential customers and then as you're
- [11:15] getting responses and you're getting to
- [11:16] meetings start prioritizing those who
- [11:18] are the most likely to close you can
- [11:21] probably tell from their answers to your
- [11:23] qualifying questions during the sales
- [11:24] call
- [11:25] avoid those who are moving slow and
- [11:28] don't be afraid of letting customers go
- [11:31] don't be afraid of letting customers go
- [11:32] what I mean by that is that if someone
- [11:34] is dragging you along two or three calls
- [11:36] you can always be like it's been great
- [11:37] getting to know you
- [11:39] um and I've learned a lot but
- [11:41] um we should talk again in six months
- [11:43] that's totally fine to say two
- [11:45] selling to people you know is going to
- [11:48] be easy to selling to strangers so you
- [11:50] should take advantage of your network
- [11:51] three selling to startups is the easiest
- [11:55] category and I've I've learned this On
- [11:57] and On Again with YC company
- [11:59] specifically the ones that sell software
- [12:01] it just turns out that bigger companies
- [12:04] have more bureaucracy more processes
- [12:07] they even have a specific Department
- [12:09] that is in charge of negotiating with
- [12:11] you and that takes a long time and
- [12:13] startups don't have any of these things
- [12:14] because they don't have time to create
- [12:15] these things but it's not a priority for
- [12:17] them
- [12:18] so startups have short decision-making
- [12:19] lines you can often find that the
- [12:22] decision maker right away as you do in
- [12:24] the Outreach and you don't have to go
- [12:25] through a difficult process that's why
- [12:28] startups are easier and that's why we
- [12:30] recommend most companies to sell to
- [12:32] startups at least leads me to the fourth
- [12:34] Point most people are not early adopters
- [12:39] and I keep saying this to the white
- [12:40] companies I work with all the time the
- [12:42] reason you have to sell send hundreds of
- [12:44] emails is not that most of those people
- [12:47] get really upset and be like I can't
- [12:49] believe you emailed me like I really
- [12:50] love this alternative product by hate
- [12:52] your product that's not what's going on
- [12:53] most people they email are just be like
- [12:56] archive they just don't care they're not
- [12:59] going to try a new product that comes in
- [13:01] through your LinkedIn or your email and
- [13:03] they might not be the people that try a
- [13:04] new product at all in their career
- [13:06] that's most people some other people I
- [13:08] remember being one of those people when
- [13:09] I worked at Airbnb I would love when
- [13:11] founders emailed me with new new
- [13:13] products and I would be the one signing
- [13:15] up for them so
- [13:17] when I worked Airbnb and you were a
- [13:19] startup email me was great I am an early
- [13:21] adopter I love trying new things I don't
- [13:23] mind the risk of trying new things so
- [13:26] for every outbound uh to an average
- [13:28] company that you send you will mostly
- [13:30] like most likely on the average outbound
- [13:32] average email average LinkedIn reach
- [13:35] someone who is not an early adopter to
- [13:37] reach early adopters you just have to
- [13:38] send more out by messages because then
- [13:41] you don't have time to convince anybody
- [13:43] to become an early adopter you have to
- [13:45] find Aero adopters and just go for them
- [13:47] early on don't worry about everybody
- [13:49] else you just don't have time to
- [13:50] convince them let's talk about charging
- [13:51] it's attractive for you as a founder and
- [13:54] for your company to offer your product
- [13:56] for free offer free trials or unpaid
- [13:59] pilots and these things come in many
- [14:02] shapes and forms however if you don't
- [14:05] charge your customers they are not a
- [14:08] customer and you don't have a company
- [14:10] customers paying you money is a great
- [14:13] sign that you're providing them real
- [14:15] value
- [14:15] so you should resist the fear of getting
- [14:18] a no because of price
- [14:20] instead of figuring out what the price
- [14:21] should be if they don't want to pay and
- [14:24] you learn this during the qualification
- [14:26] process in the first call or the first
- [14:28] meeting
- [14:29] if they don't want to pay that's a great
- [14:31] sign that you should move on to the next
- [14:34] customer
- [14:35] again fire the ones who seem like
- [14:37] they're not good fit move on to the next
- [14:39] customers
- [14:40] free trials are common for consumers but
- [14:43] if you thought about it most consumer
- [14:46] free trials ask for the credit card up
- [14:48] front and then we forget and then we pay
- [14:50] anyway
- [14:51] that's because that actually works the
- [14:53] best the bdb version of this
- [14:55] is a better one than a free trial is a
- [14:58] money back guarantee so we charge you if
- [15:01] you're not happy you can get the money
- [15:03] back in 30 days so 60 days
- [15:05] um or even better you have the ability
- [15:07] to opt out from the annual contract you
- [15:09] just pay for one month instead of the
- [15:10] annual fee but you should not offer free
- [15:13] trials in B2B sales go for a money back
- [15:15] guarantee and go for the ability to opt
- [15:17] out instead increasing your price until
- [15:20] your customers are complaining but still
- [15:22] paying is the right way to go all right
- [15:24] let's talk about the thing that most
- [15:27] Founders get wrong I've seen as many
- [15:28] times but there are a few things that
- [15:29] most wanted to get wrong and this is one
- [15:30] of them working backwards from your goal
- [15:33] with your sales funnel in order to work
- [15:35] your way backwards from a goal of say
- [15:38] two signed customers you have to
- [15:39] understand that each step in the sales
- [15:42] funnel is going to have a drop-off when
- [15:44] you haven't started sales yet you don't
- [15:46] know what these draft off percentages
- [15:49] are maybe you haven't done a lot of
- [15:50] sales before you don't know what you're
- [15:52] not good at maybe you're really good at
- [15:54] sending emails but really bad at closing
- [15:55] or vice versa you don't know that so as
- [15:58] you're sending these outbound emails you
- [16:01] need to take notes and start tracking
- [16:03] all of these conversions in this example
- [16:05] I'm sending 500 Outreach emails or
- [16:08] LinkedIn messages I have a 50 open rate
- [16:10] that means 250 people will open the
- [16:13] email five percent will respond that's
- [16:15] about 20 potential customers 50 of those
- [16:18] will convert to demo from the response
- [16:20] which means I'm doing 10 demos that's
- [16:22] pretty good but I'm not that good at
- [16:24] doing demos only two end up becoming
- [16:26] customers from the demos that's 20 I bet
- [16:29] you most of you don't even track this
- [16:31] data but you should if you track this
- [16:33] data you will have some idea of how long
- [16:35] it will take to get to 10 paying
- [16:37] customers if you don't track this it's
- [16:39] very hard for someone to give you
- [16:40] feedback of what's working and not
- [16:41] working right it's just like when you're
- [16:43] launching a new product you want to have
- [16:45] some metrics and some user data to be
- [16:47] able to tell if it's working when you're
- [16:49] doing sales you want to have this data
- [16:50] if you have this data people will be
- [16:52] able to give you feedback on what what
- [16:53] you're good at and what you need to get
- [16:54] get better at my advice is to use a
- [16:57] simple sales CRM software that tracks
- [16:59] these conversion rates automatically
- [17:00] let's look at the same second example
- [17:02] this is how it looks like for most
- [17:04] startups even the ones that I work with
- [17:06] in the batch in the second example I'm
- [17:07] sending 100 Outreach email it feels like
- [17:09] a lot to me if I keep the conversion
- [17:11] rates constant from the previous example
- [17:13] I actually end up with zero customers
- [17:15] and the conclusion the founders draw
- [17:16] after this is that sales is not working
- [17:19] for me and I should just do marketing or
- [17:21] SEO or something else or referrals or
- [17:23] something that sounds attractive this is
- [17:24] simply wrong you don't have the data to
- [17:26] make that call you did not do enough
- [17:28] Outreach to actually get to correct
- [17:30] conversion rate percentages in your
- [17:32] sales funnel so the answer here is you
- [17:34] sent a few minutes too few emails you
- [17:36] don't have the data you can't draw the
- [17:38] conclusion that sales is not working
- [17:39] even though you have serial customers
- [17:41] and this is the mistake that funders do
- [17:43] on and on and on again so to summarize
- [17:45] what I just went through here you don't
- [17:47] know your sales conversion rate that's
- [17:49] why you need a CRM to keep track of it
- [17:51] two because you don't know who is an
- [17:54] early adopter you have a lot of drop off
- [17:55] in the outbound sales that makes up on
- [17:58] sales ultimately a numbers game and
- [18:00] successful startups we like this and
- [18:01] internalize this three you cannot close
- [18:03] five customers from 10 leads it's not
- [18:05] possible you need a lot more app on than
- [18:07] that a lot more and unfortunately most
- [18:10] finders don't work their way backwards
- [18:11] from this sales funnel and they don't do
- [18:14] this exercise and the result they don't
- [18:16] succeed as sales and they don't really
- [18:18] know why so a friend of mine from Airbnb
- [18:20] Atlanta rashitzki he writes an excellent
- [18:22] blog and he wrote a great blog post
- [18:24] about how YC and a bunch of non-yc B2B
- [18:27] startups
- [18:28] um got their sales go to market strategy
- [18:31] going I recommend reading this and other
- [18:32] posts uh newsletter it's it's one of the
- [18:35] best ones I've come across it has a lot
- [18:37] of real data that he collected from real
- [18:39] companies uh many of them being YC
- [18:41] companies so in this example here in the
- [18:43] second column Lenny is describing the
- [18:46] initial sales motion of some of these
- [18:47] companies as you can see some of the
- [18:49] early ones like amplitude stripe front
- [18:52] they were doing app on sales emails just
- [18:54] like the one we described to get started
- [18:56] those Founders were doing those sales
- [18:57] emails as they get started some of the
- [18:59] other ones was called Product LED
- [19:01] product LED could mean something else
- [19:03] than just doing up on sales but it
- [19:05] doesn't mean having a big sales team and
- [19:07] it usually does not mean doing marketing
- [19:09] or SEO or something else practically it
- [19:12] means something that the product itself
- [19:13] is is sort of like driving the growth as
- [19:16] you're running the demo
- [19:18] um your goal is to close your first
- [19:19] customers
- [19:20] you want to ask a lot of questions up
- [19:22] front in the demos and there's the
- [19:24] founders who should do the demos because
- [19:25] you are the one knowing the product and
- [19:28] you know the customer pain points here
- [19:30] are three examples of YC emails that led
- [19:33] to customers so I'll let you guys look
- [19:35] at the details of these afterwards but
- [19:37] this is an app on email that led to uh
- [19:39] 72 000 a year contract this one LED is a
- [19:42] very specific email that led to out
- [19:44] Landing a goalie as a customer and this
- [19:47] third example here is the one email the
- [19:49] same email they got them 22 different
- [19:50] customers all right I'm going to
- [19:52] summarize this again the biggest
- [19:54] mistakes that most finders do is they
- [19:55] don't do enough Outreach because they
- [19:57] don't work package from the goal
- [19:59] believing that something else then sales
- [20:00] is going to solve your sales problem
- [20:02] Outsourcing sales is wrong you should do
- [20:04] it yourself and you need to qualify your
- [20:07] customers during your first call here
- [20:08] are some of the tools I recommend so
- [20:10] there are many many many tools this is
- [20:12] perhaps one of the biggest categories of
- [20:14] potential things you could use as you're
- [20:16] doing sales but I recommend apollo.io
- [20:18] close.com formerly called closed.io
- [20:21] pipedrive or hunter.io these are great
- [20:24] tools that you can use either as a
- [20:26] simple sales CRM or Hunter you can use
- [20:28] to get contacts or potential people to
- [20:31] email from LinkedIn here are two
- [20:33] additional resources if some people ask
- [20:34] me for books usually there aren't good
- [20:36] books but there is actually one that I
- [20:37] come across I find really good it's
- [20:38] called founding sales and then I also
- [20:40] recommend lineage newsletter.com there
- [20:43] are of course other ways that you can
- [20:44] grow as a startup but the truth that
- [20:47] I've learned is that even if you end up
- [20:49] with say like Airbnb where the sources
- [20:53] of growth is Word of Mouth Google search
- [20:56] referrals Facebook advertising if those
- [21:00] are the kind of end states of your
- [21:02] growth strategy that's not how ambica
- [21:05] started they didn't start by running
- [21:06] Google sem or Google SEO
- [21:08] the referral program did not bring in
- [21:10] the first 2000 customers they did things
- [21:13] that didn't scale and they looked
- [21:15] different than the one they do at scale
- [21:17] so a lot of companies are shorting
- [21:19] straight into What's called the scalable
- [21:21] growth channels the channels that
- [21:22] they've heard work which is true at
- [21:25] scale but that's not the same thing as
- [21:27] when you're getting started so in this
- [21:30] slide I'm outlining kind of like just a
- [21:32] rough idea of like even if it turns out
- [21:35] the Google sem and Google SEO is what's
- [21:37] going to work at scale you need to find
- [21:38] another place online where these people
- [21:40] that you're going to reach through sem
- [21:42] and SEO is identifying themselves online
- [21:44] right and that might not be the same as
- [21:46] Google if you're trying to go after sem
- [21:49] which means search engine marketing it's
- [21:51] going to be expensive probably because
- [21:52] there's competition if you're going
- [21:54] after SEO it's going to take a long time
- [21:56] if your growth is say proc LED or
- [21:59] virality referrals then personal
- [22:02] networks selling through your personal
- [22:03] Network to your co-workers is the way to
- [22:06] get started of course if you're doing
- [22:07] sales you should be doing sales it
- [22:08] doesn't change very much like early
- [22:10] stage sales to to large sales basically
- [22:13] means all the things that I just
- [22:14] described here
- [22:15] done by 100 people in a sales team with
- [22:17] more automation more tools more metrics
- [22:19] but it's the same thing and if you
- [22:21] practice setup to do online marketing
- [22:23] it's not usually how most people start
- [22:25] why because you can't really easily talk
- [22:28] to people you can't learn from users if
- [22:32] the first thousand or first-handed
- [22:33] customers are brought in through Google
- [22:34] and Facebook those people are not the
- [22:36] kind of people that you can easily get
- [22:38] on a 30 minute phone call with all right
- [22:40] that's all I had today thank you
- [22:42] everyone
