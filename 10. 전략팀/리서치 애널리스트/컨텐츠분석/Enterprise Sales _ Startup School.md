## Key insight / summary

- **창업자가 직접 세일즈해야 함**: 초기 스타트업에서는 창업자만이 제품을 팔 수 있고, 외부 세일즈 인력 고용은 PMF 이전에는 효과적이지 않음 (기술적 배경의 창업자도 도메인 전문성과 확신을 바탕으로 세일즈 가능)
- **명확한 세일즈 가설 필요**: "고객 X는 문제 Y를 가지고 있고, 우리 제품이 이를 해결한다"는 구체적인 가설로 프로스펙팅을 체계화해야 함
- **나쁜 고객 피하기**: 이야기하기 쉬운 고객(스타트업, 개별 직원)보다는 실제로 문제를 가지고 구매력이 있는 고객에게 집중해야 함
- **첫 통화는 자격 평가**: 첫 통화에서 바로 피치하지 말고, 고객이 실제 문제를 가지고 있는지, 예산과 의사결정권이 있는지 질문을 통해 파악
- **듣기 중심의 세일즈**: 세일즈는 심리적 트릭이 아니라 고객 문제를 깊이 이해하고 도움을 주는 것이며, 질문과 경청이 핵심
- **단계별 세일즈 퍼널**: 프로스펙팅 → 아웃리치 → 자격평가 → 가격책정 → 클로징 → 구현의 체계적 접근 필요
- **인바운드 수요 창출**: 콜드 아웃리치보다는 콘텐츠, 데모, 업계 포럼 참여를 통해 고객이 먼저 연락하도록 하는 것이 효율적
- **개인화된 접근**: 대량 발송이 아닌 개별 작성된 짧고 명확한 이메일로 특정한 이유를 들어 연락

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **창업자 주도 세일즈 전략 수립**: Proby 창업자가 직접 초기 고객 개발을 진행해야 하며, 외부 세일즈 인력 고용 전에 창업자가 세일즈 프로세스를 완전히 체득하고 재현 가능한 형태로 만들어야 함

- **타겟 고객 우선순위 재정립**: 전략문서의 3개 세그먼트(스타트업 PM/PD, 유니콘 리서처, 엔터프라이즈 리서처) 중 실제 구매력과 의사결정권이 있는 유니콘/엔터프라이즈 리서처에 초점을 맞추고, 개별 직원보다는 팀/부서 단위 의사결정자와 대화해야 함

- **구체적인 세일즈 가설 개발**: "한국/글로벌 유니콘 회사의 인하우스 UX 리서처들은 해외 시장 조사 시 언어 장벽과 높은 비용 문제를 가지고 있고, Proby의 AI 모더레이션이 이를 10분의 1 비용으로 해결한다"와 같은 명확한 가설 수립

- **자격 평가 질문 세트 개발**: 첫 세일즈 콜에서 활용할 질문들을 준비해야 함 - "현재 정성조사를 얼마나 자주 하시나요?", "해외 조사 시 가장 큰 어려움은?", "연간 리서치 예산은?", "리서치 도구 도입 시 누가 결정하나요?" 등

- **인바운드 수요 창출 콘텐츠 전략**: UX 리서처들이 모이는 온라인 커뮤니티에서 AI 모더레이션 관련 전문성을 보여주는 콘텐츠(블로그, 데모 영상, 케이스 스터디) 제작하고, 업계 컨퍼런스 참석을 통한 네트워킹 강화

- **셀프서브 데모 고도화**: 잠재 고객이 직접 체험할 수 있는 인터랙티브 데모를 만들어 바이럴 확산 가능하도록 하고, 데모 사용자의 연락처와 사용 패턴을 추적하여 세일즈 리드로 전환

- **워밍업 아웃리치 최적화**: 링크드인에서 공통 연결고리를 찾아 따뜻한 소개를 받는 프로세스를 체계화하고, 콜드 이메일 시에도 각 리서처의 최근 프로젝트나 회사 상황을 언급하여 개인화된 메시지 작성

- **Enterprise vs Bottom-up 접근법 명확화**: 전략문서에서 언급된 대로 대기업은 top-down 의사결정이 필요하므로, 개별 리서처가 아닌 리서치 팀장이나 CPO급과의 미팅을 목표로 하는 반면, 유니콘은 팀 단위 도입이 가능한지 검증 필요

- [00:09] my name is Pete Kuman I'm a group
- [00:11] partner at YC and a YC Alum I was
- [00:14] co-founder and CTO of optimis Le in the
- [00:16] winter 2010 batch in this talk I'm going
- [00:19] to walk step by step through the process
- [00:21] of closing your first Enterprise
- [00:23] customers I'm going to do that by
- [00:24] focusing on successive steps in the
- [00:26] sales funnel prospecting Outreach
- [00:30] qualification pricing closing and
- [00:33] implementation I'll do my best to
- [00:35] include lots of tactical advice and
- [00:37] counterintuitive lessons I picked up
- [00:39] while I was learning how to sell at
- [00:41] optimiz Le I'm going to focus on
- [00:43] Enterprise sales for software startups
- [00:46] but this talk should still be broadly
- [00:47] useful to any founder getting started
- [00:49] with sales regardless of the size of
- [00:51] your customers or what you're selling
- [00:53] why am I giving this talk well first I
- [00:56] know there's demand for this sales is
- [00:58] the number one concern during the the
- [01:00] batch for most of the founders that I
- [01:01] work with at YC second I know from
- [01:05] experience that sales is a learnable
- [01:07] skill my co-founder Dan and I both had
- [01:10] technical backgrounds we knew how to
- [01:12] build a product but we didn't know how
- [01:14] to get people to use it we figured it
- [01:16] out through trial and error and that's
- [01:19] the first big lesson I want to impart
- [01:21] today if you're the founder of an early
- [01:24] stage startup and you're building a
- [01:26] product that you're hoping other
- [01:27] businesses will buy you are capable of
- [01:30] selling it that's the good news the bad
- [01:32] news is that you're probably the only
- [01:35] person capable of selling your product
- [01:37] that is if you aren't able to sell your
- [01:39] product yourself at first chances are
- [01:41] you're not going to be able to hire
- [01:43] somebody else to do it for you now if
- [01:45] you're anything like we were you're
- [01:47] probably thinking there are lots of
- [01:49] talented salespeople out there wouldn't
- [01:51] it be faster to hire one of them than
- [01:53] try to do it ourselves after all that's
- [01:55] what youd probably do with any other
- [01:56] role like designers or lawyers or
- [01:59] accountants the problem is that sales
- [02:01] before you find product Market fit is
- [02:03] very different from sales after you find
- [02:06] product Market fit sales pre pmf is
- [02:08] fundamentally entrepreneurial it
- [02:10] requires vision and credibility with
- [02:13] customers and lots of experimentation
- [02:15] and a tight feedback loop with the
- [02:17] people building the product this is a
- [02:19] role for Founders so does that mean if
- [02:21] you're a team of technical Founders
- [02:23] building a product you should go find a
- [02:25] business co-founder to do sales well you
- [02:28] probably don't need a business
- [02:29] co-founder to sell either I've worked
- [02:32] with many technical Founders who turned
- [02:33] out to be great at selling in some cases
- [02:36] very much to their surprise so why is
- [02:39] that well if you're a technical founder
- [02:41] building a product you have several
- [02:43] advantages that will give you a big leg
- [02:45] up in selling first you're an expert
- [02:48] both in the problem you're solving and
- [02:50] the product you're building and second
- [02:52] you have conviction you sincerely
- [02:55] believe that your product will solve
- [02:57] your customer's problem expertise and
- [03:00] conviction are surprisingly important in
- [03:02] sales this is especially surprising to
- [03:04] people who mistakenly think that selling
- [03:07] is a dark art full of psychological
- [03:09] tricks sales isn't about tricking people
- [03:12] it's fundamentally about helping people
- [03:14] solve their problems and Engineers are
- [03:17] great at doing that anyway now that I've
- [03:20] hopefully convinced you that you're
- [03:21] capable of selling your product let's
- [03:23] talk about how to do that like I said
- [03:25] we're going to go through the step in a
- [03:27] typical sales funnel together let's
- [03:29] start with prospecting prospecting means
- [03:31] finding potential customers the output
- [03:35] of this step is a list of companies you
- [03:37] think might need your product and the
- [03:39] specific humans at those companies you
- [03:41] think might buy it there are lots of
- [03:43] tools you can use for prospecting but
- [03:45] before you start you need a hypothesis a
- [03:48] sales hypothesis goes something like
- [03:50] this customer X has problem Y and our
- [03:54] product will help them solve it a good
- [03:56] hypothesis makes prospecting Easy by
- [03:58] clarifying who you should be talking to
- [04:01] for example at optimizely our initial
- [04:04] hypothesis was something like this
- [04:06] marketers at small and medium Tech media
- [04:10] and e-commerce companies want to run AB
- [04:12] tests on their websites but they can't
- [04:15] because off-the-shelf experimentation
- [04:17] tools require users to write code
- [04:19] optimizely will enable them to run AB
- [04:22] tests without writing code and once you
- [04:24] have a clear hypothesis like that you
- [04:26] can get to work on prospecting start by
- [04:29] identif identifying companies that are
- [04:30] likely to suffer from the problem you're
- [04:33] solving one way to do this is to buy
- [04:35] industry lists of all of the companies
- [04:37] in a given sector and then use some
- [04:39] filtering criteria to qualify those
- [04:42] companies and narrow your target list
- [04:44] for example at optimizely we used a tool
- [04:47] called builtwith to figure out whether
- [04:50] prospects were using analytics tools and
- [04:52] JavaScript Frameworks because those were
- [04:54] signals that a company was relatively
- [04:56] sophisticated and cared about their
- [04:58] website once you have list of companies
- [05:00] you'll need to find the right humans at
- [05:03] those companies and their contact
- [05:04] information there are tools that make
- [05:06] this easier this video was recorded
- [05:09] during the winter 24 batch and many
- [05:11] Founders in the current batch are using
- [05:12] Apollo and Linkedin sales navigator for
- [05:15] that now that you have a list of leads
- [05:17] that is specific humans that are likely
- [05:19] to buy at the companies you're selling
- [05:21] to you'll need to get their attention
- [05:23] this step is called Outreach the goal of
- [05:26] Outreach is usually to schedule a
- [05:28] meeting with your prospect most Founders
- [05:30] think of cold Outreach as the primary
- [05:32] mechanism for doing this but the easiest
- [05:35] way to get a meeting with a prospect is
- [05:36] to get them to reach out to you even if
- [05:38] you're planning on using a sales Le
- [05:40] approach you should still do everything
- [05:42] you can to generate inbound demand
- [05:45] launch early and often create technical
- [05:48] content like videos and blog posts that
- [05:51] prospects can find while searching for a
- [05:53] solution to their problem build
- [05:54] self-served demos that people can share
- [05:57] find online forums where your customers
- [05:59] hang out and establish yourself as an
- [06:01] expert by answering questions there's no
- [06:04] one way to do this but the better you
- [06:06] get at grabbing your customers attention
- [06:08] and getting them to reach out to you the
- [06:10] more efficient your sales process will
- [06:12] be on that note if your customers all
- [06:15] hang out and Industry conferences you
- [06:17] should be there too find a way to get a
- [06:19] list of attendees ahead of time and set
- [06:21] up lots of meetings in advance once
- [06:23] you've identified a specific Prospect
- [06:25] you want to talk to start by trying to
- [06:27] find a warm introduction if you can look
- [06:30] on LinkedIn for shared connections and
- [06:32] ask for an intro sending cold emails is
- [06:35] usually the least efficient way of
- [06:36] getting prospects attention but it can
- [06:38] still be effective if you approach it
- [06:40] the right way start by writing each
- [06:42] email by hand make your emails short and
- [06:45] to the point and make the ask clear you
- [06:48] should also make it clear why you're
- [06:50] reaching out to each recipient
- [06:51] specifically humans have built-in spam
- [06:54] filters and if your email looks like it
- [06:56] was sent to thousands of people it's
- [06:58] going to get deleted on this last Point
- [07:00] there's a handy rule of thumb to keep in
- [07:02] mind for cold emails only send emails
- [07:04] that you yourself would be excited to
- [07:06] read if you wouldn't be excited to get
- [07:08] the email you're about to send your
- [07:10] prospect probably won't either before we
- [07:13] move on I want to spend some time
- [07:15] talking about a particular anti-pattern
- [07:17] I see with a lot of YC Founders many
- [07:19] Founders start by talking to anyone who
- [07:22] will take their call and the problem
- [07:23] with this approach is that it selects
- [07:25] for the people who are easiest to talk
- [07:27] to not the people who will be be great
- [07:30] customers so if you're not disciplined
- [07:31] about it you'll end up wasting all your
- [07:33] time chasing bad customers that are easy
- [07:36] to talk to I see YC Founders make this
- [07:38] mistake all the time and I get it when
- [07:41] you're starting a company it's hard to
- [07:42] get people to pay attention to you cold
- [07:45] emailing is a demoralizing grind so it's
- [07:48] tempting to go after the people who will
- [07:50] talk to you even if they won't ever buy
- [07:52] your product and the reason this mistake
- [07:54] is so dangerous is because talking to
- [07:56] bad customers gives you the illusion
- [07:59] that you're making progress when you're
- [08:00] not you'll get lotss of great product
- [08:02] feedback from people who think they're
- [08:04] doing you a favor but because you're not
- [08:06] actually talking to someone who needs
- [08:07] your product this kind of feedback is
- [08:09] useless at best and counterproductive at
- [08:12] worst in practice I see Founders make
- [08:14] this mistake in two ways first by trying
- [08:18] to sell enterprise software to startups
- [08:21] now if your product solves a problem
- [08:23] that companies only have when they get
- [08:25] big like for example an HR information
- [08:28] system then trying to sell it to
- [08:29] startups is a waste of time but Founders
- [08:32] still do it all the time because other
- [08:34] startups are much easier to talk to than
- [08:36] busy big company Executives and the
- [08:39] second is trying to go bottom up with a
- [08:42] product that needs to be adopted top
- [08:45] down and that's a little jargony so let
- [08:47] me illustrate it with an example imagine
- [08:49] you're building productivity software
- [08:51] like notion your product can be adopted
- [08:54] bottom up meaning that individual
- [08:55] employees or teams can start using it
- [08:58] independently without having to
- [08:59] coordinate with anyone else inside the
- [09:01] company and in this case talking to
- [09:04] individual contributors or their direct
- [09:06] managers is totally fine but what if
- [09:08] you're building building software for
- [09:10] large hospitals in order for a hospital
- [09:12] to start using your product you're going
- [09:14] to need a lot of different teams to
- [09:16] coordinate with each other so you might
- [09:18] need the CIO to sign off on your
- [09:20] security and compliance and you need
- [09:22] their software team to integrate your
- [09:25] product with their in-house systems you
- [09:27] need the doctors to enter billing codes
- [09:29] at after each appointment and you need
- [09:31] their Ops Team to manage Collections and
- [09:33] so on and so on and in this case talking
- [09:35] to an individual doctor won't be useful
- [09:37] you need to talk to a senior leader like
- [09:39] a CFO or a CIO to do a deal now there's
- [09:43] a meme that YC says you should sell to
- [09:46] companies who will buy quickly even if
- [09:48] they aren't good customers this is a
- [09:51] misconception you should try to find
- [09:53] companies that will buy quickly but you
- [09:55] shouldn't spend time trying to sell to
- [09:57] companies that don't actually need your
- [09:58] product or won't be good customers you
- [10:01] need to find people who have the problem
- [10:03] you're solving and the budget and
- [10:05] decision-making authority to buy your
- [10:07] product we'll spend more time on this
- [10:09] point later let's get back to our sales
- [10:10] funnel so you've managed to get your
- [10:13] prospect on the phone your job on the
- [10:14] first call is not to sell your product
- [10:18] that comes later in the first call we're
- [10:20] just trying to do two things first we're
- [10:23] trying to qualify our Prospect by
- [10:26] figuring out whether they have the
- [10:27] problem we're trying to solve and the
- [10:29] budget and decision-making authority to
- [10:31] buy the product and second we're trying
- [10:34] to schedule a follow-up call for a
- [10:36] product demo now many Founders face
- [10:38] plant in the first call by diving
- [10:40] straight into their pitch these Founders
- [10:42] are making one of the biggest founder
- [10:44] sales mistakes not asking enough
- [10:46] questions and they make this mistake
- [10:48] because they misunderstand how sales
- [10:51] work they think of the company they're
- [10:53] trying to sell to as a big monolithic
- [10:56] entity and they think of the sales
- [10:57] process as adversar
- [10:59] where it's their job to come up with a
- [11:01] perfect pitch that will break down their
- [11:03] targets defenses but outside of some
- [11:05] used car dealerships that's not how
- [11:08] sales works in the real world in the
- [11:10] real world you're almost always selling
- [11:12] to an individual human not a big
- [11:15] monolithic entity and that's good news
- [11:17] because humans are easier to understand
- [11:19] than organizations and that turns out to
- [11:21] be really important in the real world
- [11:24] sales is not adversarial it's about
- [11:26] deeply understanding a customer's
- [11:28] problem and help helping them solve it
- [11:30] and great salespeople spend most of
- [11:32] their time listening because that's the
- [11:35] best way to understand someone's problem
- [11:37] they ask all sorts of questions what
- [11:39] made you decide to take this call tell
- [11:41] me about this problem how long have you
- [11:43] had it how bad is it who else does it
- [11:46] affect how do you quantify the impact
- [11:49] why haven't you solved it already what's
- [11:51] your budget for solving it how does your
- [11:54] organization buy software who makes the
- [11:57] buying decision who else will need to
- [11:59] weigh in on this decision now sometimes
- [12:02] when you ask questions like these you
- [12:04] discover that your prospect doesn't
- [12:05] actually have the problem you're trying
- [12:07] to solve or they have it but they don't
- [12:10] care enough about it to buy a solution
- [12:12] or they don't have any budget or any
- [12:13] number of other reasons that they won't
- [12:16] actually be a good customer for you and
- [12:18] if you do that that's great you just
- [12:20] saved yourself and your prospect a lot
- [12:22] of time and you can focus your energy on
- [12:25] other prospects that are more likely to
- [12:26] buy now if on the other hand it turns
- [12:29] out that your prospect does have a
- [12:31] problem you can solve you're in luck
- [12:33] you've earned the opportunity to show
- [12:35] them how your product works the next
- [12:37] step is a demo most Founders think of a
- [12:40] demo as a chance to finally show off
- [12:42] their product in my experience thinking
- [12:45] about it this way is a Surefire way to
- [12:47] deliver a bad demo that's because your
- [12:50] job in a demo is not to show off your
- [12:53] product it's to convince your audience
- [12:55] that you can help them solve their
- [12:57] problem and one helpful trick I've
- [12:59] learned is to think of your demo as the
- [13:01] script for a great movie a great script
- [13:03] always starts with a recap of who the
- [13:06] main character is that's your user and
- [13:09] the problem she's trying to solve this
- [13:11] is your chance to demonstrate how well
- [13:13] you were listening during your first
- [13:14] call if your audience believes you
- [13:17] understand their company and their
- [13:18] problems they're going to take you
- [13:20] seriously when you talk about how to
- [13:21] solve them when you're ready to show the
- [13:23] product resist the urge to take your
- [13:25] audience on a feature tour where you
- [13:28] walk from screen to screen showing them
- [13:30] everything your product can do instead
- [13:33] tell a story that shows exactly how your
- [13:35] main character solves her problem and
- [13:37] this is the point great demos actually
- [13:40] feel like good stories they have a flow
- [13:43] where each step leads to the next and
- [13:45] every feature you show has a clear
- [13:47] reason for being there they usually have
- [13:50] one or more magic moments where you
- [13:52] surprise your audience with how easy or
- [13:54] delightful something is and great demos
- [13:57] are also personalized for the audience
- [13:59] this is where you get to use all of the
- [14:01] information you collected during that
- [14:03] first call tailor the demo to their
- [14:06] company use their logo their website
- [14:09] their customers uh the names of the
- [14:11] people on their team the more you can do
- [14:13] to help them visualize exactly how your
- [14:15] product would work in their company the
- [14:17] better I'll give you an example from the
- [14:19] early days of optimizely when Dan and I
- [14:22] started building we booked demos with
- [14:24] all of our competitors and every single
- [14:27] one of them used a website to show what
- [14:30] it was like to use their products to run
- [14:33] AB tests and we thought this was really
- [14:35] lame so we spent weeks building a
- [14:37] feature that made it easy to demo our
- [14:39] product right on our customers websites
- [14:42] instead of a dummy website and I knew it
- [14:44] was worth it when I saw marketer eyes
- [14:46] light up when they watched us change
- [14:48] things on their landing page that would
- [14:50] have taken them months to do on their
- [14:51] own so if you do a good job your
- [14:54] prospects and their team will come out
- [14:56] of this meeting convinced that you can
- [14:58] solve their problem and if that's the
- [15:00] case it's time to talk about pricing I
- [15:02] get a lot of questions from Founders
- [15:04] asking how to price their products and
- [15:06] the truth is there isn't a simple
- [15:08] formula for doing this so if there isn't
- [15:11] a formula how do you pick a number well
- [15:13] fortunately you can ask questions
- [15:15] earlier in the process that will make
- [15:17] your job easier here like how much is
- [15:19] this problem costing your company how
- [15:22] many people are responsible for
- [15:23] maintaining your in-house solution
- [15:25] what's your budget for solving this
- [15:27] problem how much are you spending on my
- [15:29] competitor and it's okay to wait to
- [15:32] share your pricing until you've had a
- [15:33] chance to ask these questions in fact if
- [15:36] your product requires lots of work or
- [15:39] customization to implement you probably
- [15:41] shouldn't quote a price until you
- [15:43] understand exactly what your customer
- [15:44] needs in any case even if you asked all
- [15:48] of these questions upfront the reality
- [15:50] is that pricing involves a lot of
- [15:51] guessing in the beginning and the advice
- [15:53] that I give to startups is to think of
- [15:55] each pricing conversation you have as an
- [15:58] opportunity to run an experiment in
- [16:00] which you test a price point and then
- [16:02] learn from your prospect's reaction to
- [16:04] it in the early days of optimizely we
- [16:06] had published self-serve pricing for
- [16:08] customers who just wanted to swipe a
- [16:10] credit card for a basic version of our
- [16:11] product and an Enterprise plan that
- [16:14] required you to go through sales we
- [16:16] didn't publish pricing for the
- [16:17] Enterprise plan which gave us the
- [16:19] flexibility to try a different price
- [16:21] each time the pricing mistake that
- [16:23] Founders make most often is charging too
- [16:26] little for their product or even making
- [16:28] it free in exchange for product feedback
- [16:30] Founders do this because they're worried
- [16:32] about charging too much they think
- [16:34] they're going to scare customers away
- [16:36] one of the most surprising things I
- [16:38] learned was that when a customer really
- [16:40] wants your product it's hard to scare
- [16:42] them away by quoting a price that's too
- [16:44] high for example I remember my
- [16:46] co-founder Dan coming out of a sales
- [16:48] call and telling me that he'd worked up
- [16:49] the nerve to quote the prospect $10,000
- [16:52] a month for our software and the
- [16:54] prospect ended up talking us down to
- [16:56] 2,000 a month and then buying our
- [16:58] initial quote was 5x what they were
- [17:00] willing to pay and they still bought in
- [17:02] fact higher prices can help you figure
- [17:04] out whether customers actually need your
- [17:06] product the cison brothers famously
- [17:09] charged more for stripe in the beginning
- [17:11] than their competition did the fact that
- [17:13] they were able to sell their product
- [17:15] anyway was compelling evidence that they
- [17:17] were on to something and it helped them
- [17:19] focus on the customers who were most
- [17:21] desperate for a solution high prices
- [17:23] make customers more serious this brings
- [17:26] me to another important point about
- [17:27] pricing remember that the most important
- [17:30] conversations about pricing will happen
- [17:32] without you in the room your prospect
- [17:34] will need to convince others in the
- [17:36] organization that your product is worth
- [17:38] the price you're asking you can make
- [17:39] their job easier by giving them slides
- [17:42] or a PDF one pager that explains how
- [17:44] your pricing works it's usually a good
- [17:46] idea to include an overview of your
- [17:48] product and the benefits of using it in
- [17:50] case your prospect needs to talk to
- [17:52] people who aren't familiar with it in
- [17:54] any case don't spend too much time
- [17:56] thinking about pricing in the beginning
- [17:58] pick number ideally one that makes you a
- [18:00] little uncomfortable and pay attention
- [18:02] to how your prospect reacts it's okay to
- [18:05] let them negotiate you down remember in
- [18:08] your first few sales you're optimizing
- [18:10] for learning not unit economics now that
- [18:13] you've agreed on a price it's time to
- [18:15] close the deal closing is not a single
- [18:18] conversation it's a bunch of things that
- [18:20] need to happen from the moment your
- [18:22] customer decides they want your product
- [18:24] to the moment they actually buy it big
- [18:26] companies especially ones in highly
- [18:28] regulated Industries have formal
- [18:30] procurement processes that usually
- [18:32] include stuff like security and privacy
- [18:34] reviews legal reviews and signoff from
- [18:37] compliance teams it's less formal in
- [18:39] smaller companies but you should expect
- [18:41] at a minimum to go through a redlining
- [18:43] process with their legal team the
- [18:44] biggest mistake that I see Founders make
- [18:46] at this stage is getting surprised and
- [18:49] discovering that what they thought was a
- [18:50] done deal is in fact not done at all and
- [18:53] may take weeks or months of additional
- [18:55] back and forth or fall through
- [18:57] completely now the way to avoid getting
- [18:59] surprised is once again to ask a lot of
- [19:02] questions asking your prospect upfront
- [19:05] how they buy software and who needs to
- [19:07] sign off will give you a clear picture
- [19:09] of the hurdles you're going to have to
- [19:11] overcome in order to get a signature you
- [19:13] should do everything you can at this
- [19:15] stage to move through the procurement
- [19:17] process quickly ask explicitly if there
- [19:21] are steps like filling out a security
- [19:22] questionnaire that you can get started
- [19:24] on early and execute in parallel and
- [19:26] keep your legal documents as simple as
- [19:28] possible I recommend starting with the
- [19:30] open- source templates published by YC
- [19:32] company common paper keep timelines and
- [19:34] scope of work out of the legal contract
- [19:36] if you can and put them in an order form
- [19:38] or a shared project tracking document
- [19:40] instead and most importantly remember
- [19:42] that your prospect who at this point has
- [19:44] become your Champion is your biggest
- [19:47] Ally you should be in constant
- [19:49] communication with them and when you
- [19:51] need help getting something unstuck you
- [19:53] should ask them first remember they
- [19:56] can't solve their problem until you get
- [19:58] through procurement so they're heavily
- [20:00] incentivized to help you make it happen
- [20:02] now that you have a signature
- [20:04] congratulations it's time for your
- [20:06] customer to actually start using your
- [20:08] product this is the implementation and
- [20:10] it's the last step we're going to talk
- [20:11] about today and I'm going to lead with
- [20:13] this the single biggest mistake that
- [20:16] Founders make is thinking that
- [20:18] implementation is the customer's job we
- [20:21] made this mistake more than once at
- [20:23] optimizely in fact we closed six figure
- [20:26] deals with customers that were excited
- [20:28] about our product and then we discovered
- [20:30] a year later when it was time for them
- [20:32] to renew that they hadn't run a single
- [20:34] AB test with optimizely and this was
- [20:36] confusing at first why would a customer
- [20:38] who is willing to pay so much for a
- [20:40] product fail to use it at all in this
- [20:43] case the approximate cause is that the
- [20:45] marketing team who bought our software
- [20:47] couldn't convince the software
- [20:48] engineering team to help them install it
- [20:50] on their website the real cause though
- [20:53] is we didn't do our jobs we thought our
- [20:55] customer was buying a product so we sold
- [20:57] them one and left the rest up to them in
- [21:00] reality our customers were buying a
- [21:03] solution to a problem and all of the
- [21:05] work required to get from product to
- [21:08] solution was our responsibility we
- [21:11] learned to start asking marketing
- [21:13] leaders about the work required to
- [21:15] implement optimizely very early in the
- [21:17] sales process we started building
- [21:20] detailed implementation plans with
- [21:22] marketing and Engineering leaders well
- [21:24] before a contract got signed and in fact
- [21:27] if we weren't able to do that we
- [21:29] wouldn't sign a contract at all and the
- [21:31] trick we learned was to treat the
- [21:33] customer implementation the same way
- [21:35] that we would a high priority project
- [21:37] inside of our own company by project
- [21:39] managing it so we put together a shared
- [21:41] road map we made sure that every task
- [21:44] headed owner we set up regular check-in
- [21:46] meetings to hold everyone on our side
- [21:48] and theirs accountable for getting it
- [21:50] done your sales funnel only really ends
- [21:53] when your customer is using your product
- [21:55] habitually and when you get to that
- [21:56] point congratulations hopefully you have
- [21:59] a customer for life all right we've
- [22:02] covered a lot today from prospecting to
- [22:05] doing your first call delivering a great
- [22:07] demo pricing closing and finally
- [22:10] managing the implementation of course
- [22:13] there's so much more to learn about
- [22:14] sales and the best Founders devour
- [22:17] everything they can on the topic if you
- [22:19] want to go deeper I recommend Peter
- [22:21] kazi's book founding sales it's a
- [22:24] fantastic resource and it's free online
- [22:27] but like most most of the hard things
- [22:29] about building a company the best way to
- [22:31] learn is by going out and doing the
- [22:32] thing so if you only remember one thing
- [22:34] it should be this just get started
- [22:37] you'll make mistakes but with enough
- [22:39] attempts you'll figure it out and
- [22:40] selling will start to feel natural
- [22:42] pretty soon you'll discover that you've
- [22:44] acquired a new superpower you'll find
- [22:46] it's useful not only in getting
- [22:48] customers and revenue but in fundraising
- [22:50] and hiring too and soon enough you'll be
- [22:53] the one giving advice like this to new
- [22:55] Founders thanks for watching
