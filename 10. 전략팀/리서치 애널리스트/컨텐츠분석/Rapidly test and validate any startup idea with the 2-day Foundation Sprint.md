## Key insight / summary

- **Foundation Sprint의 핵심**: 팀이 10시간 동안 일정을 비우고 모여서 "누가 우리 타겟 고객인가", "무엇을 만들 것인가", "어떻게 차별화할 것인가"에 대한 핵심 결정을 함께 내리는 프로세스
- **창업팀의 공통 실패 패턴**: 공동창업자 3명이 타겟 고객에 대해 3가지 다른 답변을 하는 상황 (기본기를 모르거나, 알아도 테스트하지 않는 것)
- **AI 시대의 역설**: AI로 빠르게 만들수록 제품이 더 범용적(generic)이 되는 경향 - 속도보다는 깊은 사고를 통한 차별화가 중요
- **"빠르게 만들어서 런칭하고 배우자"의 함정**: 실제로는 천천히 하고 깊게 생각하는 것이 장기적으로 더 빠른 결과를 만들어냄
- **Design Sprint의 진화**: Google에서 시작된 5일 프로세스(Map → Sketch → Decide → Prototype → Test)에서 더 초기 단계의 Foundation Sprint로 발전
- **Foundation Sprint가 필요한 이유**: Design Sprint 이전에 "무엇을 만들지, 누구를 위해 만들지"에 대한 기반적 정렬이 선행되어야 함
- **투자자 관점에서의 니즈**: Pre-seed, 초기 단계 회사들은 제품 개발 이전에 기본적인 전략적 질문들에 대한 답이 정렬되지 않은 경우가 많음
- **프로토타입 중심 사고**: 완벽한 기획서나 프레젠테이션보다는 실제로 테스트할 수 있는 프로토타입을 만드는 것이 더 효과적
- **팀 정렬의 중요성**: 모든 핵심 팀원이 동일한 가설과 방향에 대해 합의하고 정렬되는 것이 성공의 전제조건

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **Proby 팀 내부 Foundation Sprint 실행**: McKinsey 문서에서 지적한 "타겟 고객 우선순위 부재" 문제를 해결하기 위해 창업팀이 10시간 동안 모여 "유니콘 리서처 vs 스타트업 PM vs 엔터프라이즈 리서처" 중 명확한 1순위를 정해야 함
- **AI 차별화 전략 재점검**: "AI로 빠르게 만들수록 generic해진다"는 인사이트를 바탕으로, Proby의 AI 모더레이션이 단순한 자동화가 아닌 깊은 인사이트를 제공하는 차별화된 경험이 되도록 제품 철학을 재정립해야 함
- **고객 테스트 우선주의**: McKinsey 문서의 "검증되지 않은 가정들"을 Foundation Sprint 방식으로 해결 - AI 모더레이션 품질, 연구자들의 셀프서브 도구 수용성 등을 90일 내에 실제 타겟 고객 20-30명과 테스트
- **프로토타입 기반 세일즈**: 완벽한 기능을 만들어 출시하기보다는, 핵심 가치를 증명할 수 있는 MVP를 만들어 잠재 고객(특히 유니콘 리서처)에게 직접 체험시키는 전략으로 전환
- **경쟁사 대응 전략**: McKinsey 문서에서 지적한 "약한 경쟁 분석"을 Foundation Sprint로 해결 - UserTesting, Remesh 등 기존 플레이어들과 어떻게 차별화할지 팀 차원에서 명확히 정의
- **B2B 세일즈 프로세스 재설계**: Foundation Sprint의 "팀 정렬" 개념을 고객사에 적용 - Proby 도입을 고려하는 기업의 의사결정자들(리서처, 프로덕트 매니저, 구매 담당자)을 한자리에 모아 함께 리서치 니즈를 정의하는 워크샵 형태의 세일즈 접근법 개발
- **글로벌 진출 우선순위**: Foundation Sprint 방식으로 "한국 → 영어권 → 일본/동남아 → 유럽" 중 어느 시장부터 집중할지 데이터와 테스트 기반으로 결정하고, 전 팀이 하나의 시장에 리소스를 집중하는 전략 수립

- [00:00] We would have a conversation with
- [00:01] founders. You're saying like, gosh, I'm
- [00:03] I'm almost embarrassed to ask this
- [00:04] question, but who exactly is your target
- [00:06] customer? And three co-founders have
- [00:08] three different answers. After these
- [00:10] hundreds of teams that we've worked
- [00:11] with, we've seen that there's one
- [00:13] failure mode, which is they don't know
- [00:15] what that set of basics are. Then
- [00:17] there's this other failure mode where
- [00:18] they never test it.
- [00:19] Let's talk about the foundation sprint.
- [00:20] Walk us through the process. How does it
- [00:22] start? What are the steps?
- [00:23] The very beginning of your project, we
- [00:25] recommend this kind of crazy idea that
- [00:28] you clear your calendar. So the core
- [00:30] team come together for 10 hours roughly
- [00:32] and go through a sequence of activities
- [00:35] so that we can make all of the key
- [00:36] decisions together. I think a lot of
- [00:38] people wonder as they're hearing this is
- [00:39] why don't I just build something and
- [00:41] launch it and learn.
- [00:42] One phenomenon we've seen when teams are
- [00:44] building things really quickly with AI
- [00:46] is that the more AI generated or
- [00:48] assisted they are, the more generic they
- [00:50] tend to turn out. Put yourself in a
- [00:52] situation where you can slow down and do
- [00:54] some hard thinking, some deep thinking
- [00:55] about what's actually going to make your
- [00:57] product unique. going fast can actually
- [00:59] slow you down in the long run.
- [01:01] Today, my guests are Jake Knap and John
- [01:03] Zeratsky. The framework that Jake and
- [01:05] John share in this conversation is
- [01:07] basically the missing manual for
- [01:09] founders and product teams trying to
- [01:10] refine and test their startup or product
- [01:12] idea. It's called the foundation sprint
- [01:14] and it emerged out of the famous design
- [01:16] sprint which Jake and Jay-Z co-created
- [01:18] and also from working with over 300
- [01:20] teams building both new products at
- [01:22] startups and also with teams at larger
- [01:24] companies like Google, Microsoft,
- [01:26] YouTube, Slack, Uber and many more. They
- [01:28] published a book with this framework at
- [01:30] the beginning of this year called Click
- [01:31] and the excerpt from that book that
- [01:33] dives into this framework is one of my
- [01:35] most popular post of all time and is one
- [01:37] of the rare nonAI posts amongst the top
- [01:39] post rankings. In this conversation,
- [01:41] make sure to get your pencils out
- [01:42] because we go through exactly how to
- [01:45] execute this two-day sprint where at the
- [01:47] end of it, you have a very clear
- [01:48] hypothesis that your entire team is
- [01:51] aligned around that clarifies what
- [01:52] you're building, who you're building
- [01:53] for, how it differentiates from
- [01:55] competitors, and how to quickly test it
- [01:57] with real potential customers. The two
- [01:59] days that you invest in a sprint might
- [02:00] be the highest ROI days in the history
- [02:02] of your product. And I highly encourage
- [02:04] you to do this if you're in the process
- [02:06] of baking an idea. If you enjoy this

- [02:28] This episode is brought to you by Brex,
- [02:30] the financial stack used by one in every
- [02:33] three US venture-backed startups. Rex
- [02:36] knows that nearly 40% of startups fail
- [02:38] because they run out of cash. So, they
- [02:40] built a banking experience that focuses
- [02:42] on helping founders get more from every
- [02:44] dollar. It's a stark difference from
- [02:46] traditional banking options that leave a
- [02:48] startup's cash sitting idle while
- [02:50] chipping away at it with fees. To help
- [02:52] founders protect cash and extend runway,
- [02:54] Brex combined the best things about
- [02:56] checking, treasury, and FDIC insurance
- [02:59] in one powerhouse account. You can send
- [03:02] and receive money worldwide at lightning
- [03:04] speed. You can get 20x the standard FDIC
- [03:07] protection through program banks and you
- [03:09] can earn industry-leading yield from
- [03:11] your first dollar while still being able
- [03:13] to access your funds anytime. To learn

- [03:25] Many of you are building AI products,
- [03:27] which is why I'm very excited to chat
- [03:29] with Brandon Fu, founder and CEO of
- [03:31] Paragon. Hey, Brandon.
- [03:33] Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.
- [03:35] So, integrations have become a big deal
- [03:37] for AI products. Why is that?
- [03:40] Integrations are mission critical for AI
- [03:42] for two reasons. First, AI products need
- [03:44] contacts from their customers business
- [03:46] data such as Google Drive files, Slack
- [03:48] messages, or CRM records. Second, for AI
- [03:52] products to automate work on behalf of
- [03:53] users, AI agents need to be able to take
- [03:56] action across these different third
- [03:57] party tools. So, where does Paragon fit
- [04:00] into all this? Well, these integrations
- [04:02] are a pain to build. And that's why
- [04:03] Paragon provides an embedded platform
- [04:05] that enables engineers to ship these
- [04:07] product integrations in just days
- [04:09] instead of months across every use case
- [04:11] from rag data ingestion to agentic
- [04:14] actions. And I know from firsthand
- [04:16] experience that maintenance is even
- [04:17] harder than just building it for the
- [04:19] first time.
- [04:20] Exactly. We believe product teams should
- [04:22] focus engineering efforts on competitive
- [04:24] advantages, not integrations. That's why
- [04:26] companies like you.com, AI21, and
- [04:29] hundreds of others use Paragon to
- [04:31] accelerate their integration strategy.
- [04:33] If you want to avoid wasting months of
- [04:35] engineering on integrations that your
- [04:36] customers need, check out Paragon at
- [04:38] useparagon.com/lenny.
- [04:45] Jake and Jay-Z, thank you so much for
- [04:47] being here and welcome to the podcast.
- [04:49] Hey Lenny, thanks for having us.
- [04:51] Yeah, thanks so much for having us on
- [04:52] again. This is always a treat. This is
- [04:55] going to be a very tactical
- [04:56] conversation. We're going to be going
- [04:58] through how to actually execute a
- [05:00] foundation sprint. And the reason that
- [05:03] I'm excited to do this is you guys
- [05:04] shared an excerpt from your book where
- [05:06] you initially shared this whole concept.
- [05:08] It's called click. Uh you shared this in
- [05:10] my newsletter. And I was just looking at
- [05:12] it and that excerpt that post is amongst
- [05:15] the top 10 most popular post of all time
- [05:17] in my newsletter. Uh which is especially
- [05:20] special because it's not an AI oriented
- [05:22] book. It's one of the few non AI posts
- [05:25] that are near the top 10. Uh which just
- [05:27] tells me how valuable this is to people
- [05:28] and consistently has sat there. It
- [05:30] hasn't been usurped. It just continues
- [05:32] to climb. So I'm really excited to just
- [05:34] have a conversation where we share
- [05:36] actually how to do this. Let me just
- [05:38] start with the beginning just a little
- [05:40] backstory on how the foundation sprint
- [05:42] came to be. I know it emerged out of the
- [05:45] now very famous uh design sprint which
- [05:47] you guys also developed. So just give us
- [05:49] a very brief overview of just how this
- [05:51] came to be. this idea of this foundation
- [05:53] sprint. Well, maybe I'll start by
- [05:55] talking about the design sprint part
- [05:56] because it is essential to understanding
- [05:58] the foundation sprint and the design
- [06:02] sprint first developed I I had been
- [06:04] working at the beginning of my career at
- [06:06] Microsoft for a few years. Went to
- [06:07] Google. This is like 2007, 2008, 2009
- [06:11] and was working on the Gmail team. Was
- [06:13] working on some, you know, projects that
- [06:15] were just executing well, delivering
- [06:17] shipping.
- [06:19] But I had this other project, this side
- [06:22] project that had been going on for three
- [06:24] years with a couple of colleagues, was
- [06:27] going nowhere, and it looked like their
- [06:29] office was going to get shut down after
- [06:31] the financial crisis. They were in
- [06:32] Stockholm. I went there for a week. We
- [06:35] cleared our calendars for the week and
- [06:37] we created a prototype of this this
- [06:38] thing because we decided look we're
- [06:40] we're never going to get anywhere. We've
- [06:42] tried making the perfect pitch. We've
- [06:44] tried to, you know, make the ideal PRD.
- [06:47] We've tried to show the the ideal design
- [06:50] and we just we can't perfection is not
- [06:52] working. We're not able to align people.
- [06:54] We're not able to to get sort of
- [06:56] executive support for this thing. We
- [06:59] couldn't convince Larry and Sergey and
- [07:01] Eric that they should fund this thing.
- [07:02] And in that week in Stockholm, we
- [07:05] created a prototype instead. We decided,
- [07:07] you know what, forget it. We're just
- [07:08] going to build something and put it in
- [07:10] people's hands, put it in our fellow
- [07:11] Googler's hands. And that prototype was
- [07:16] what became Google Meet. It was this
- [07:18] video conferencing tool that you could
- [07:19] use in the in the web browser.
- [07:20] No big deal.
- [07:21] Yeah, it was it was really cool. I mean,
- [07:23] the the the outcome of that that's
- [07:24] definitely probably the most productive
- [07:25] week I've ever I've ever had. But the uh
- [07:29] the thing that struck me at the time and
- [07:31] in in hindsight was wow, it was so
- [07:33] different to clear the calendar for a
- [07:35] week and have the entire focal point of
- [07:37] every person on the team be how do we
- [07:40] create a prototype that's so real that
- [07:42] that works so well that people will
- [07:44] think it's real that they'll react like
- [07:46] it's real that they'll want it. And we
- [07:49] were in survival mode, you know, we were
- [07:51] trying to keep that office from getting
- [07:52] shut down. But the the notion that maybe
- [07:55] you could repeat that and recreate that
- [07:56] is what led me to create the design
- [07:58] sprint. So for a couple of years at
- [08:01] Google, I start running these oneweek
- [08:03] programs with teams trying to go at the
- [08:05] beginning of a project from you know
- [08:07] zero to a prototype at the end that we
- [08:11] can that we could sort of evaluate test
- [08:14] and then I went to go work at Google
- [08:16] ventures. So separate one of the
- [08:18] alphabet companies were investing in
- [08:20] startups. I meet John Zeratsky and we
- [08:23] start running these design sprints with
- [08:25] well it turned out to be over the course
- [08:27] of five years uh I don't know couple
- [08:30] hundred teams
- [08:31] working in the early days with founders
- [08:34] the early days of their you establishing
- [08:36] the product for the first time trying to
- [08:38] build it from zero to to one or a new
- [08:42] marketing campaign a new ad campaign
- [08:43] some big high-risk endeavor we'd get to
- [08:45] work alongside them for a week and we
- [08:47] ended up refining this process into a
- [08:49] recipe so across five days it's map,
- [08:53] sketch, decide, prototype, and test. One
- [08:56] big focal point for each day. So, at the
- [08:58] end of the week, you've got a tested
- [09:00] prototype, and you learn like, are we on
- [09:01] the right track or or not? And that's
- [09:05] the that's the design sprint. That's
- [09:06] kind of the the, you know, the prologue,
- [09:09] the backstory to this thing. And then
- [09:12] after a few years at Google Ventures,
- [09:14] John and I left and eventually together
- [09:17] with our co-founder Eli Goldman, we
- [09:19] started our own venture firm, Character
- [09:21] Capital. And that's kind of where the
- [09:22] story of the foundation sprint comes in.
- [09:25] Okay. Awesome. Uh Jay-Z, anything you
- [09:27] wanted to add?
- [09:29] One of our goals, probably our biggest
- [09:30] goal for starting our own VC firm was
- [09:33] that we wanted to be able to focus on
- [09:36] just the kinds of companies and the
- [09:38] stage of company building that was the
- [09:41] most fun to us, but also was where we
- [09:42] thought we could have the biggest
- [09:44] impact. And so, you know, for us with
- [09:46] our background as as designers, that is
- [09:49] the early days, the first couple of
- [09:51] months or the first year or two years of
- [09:53] building a a new business. And at GV,
- [09:56] you know, sometimes we did that, but
- [09:57] sometimes we were working with with
- [09:58] companies that were already well
- [10:00] established. And when we'd come into
- [10:01] those companies, they kind of knew what
- [10:03] they were doing. They knew what they
- [10:05] stood for. They knew how they were
- [10:06] different in the market and how they
- [10:07] were positioned. And so we could help
- [10:10] them, you know, answer these big
- [10:11] questions and solve these problems and
- [10:13] test their prototypes with customers.
- [10:15] But when we started investing in, you
- [10:17] know, truly preede, sometimes inception
- [10:20] stage, you know, pre-product,
- [10:22] pre-revenue, pre- everything companies,
- [10:24] there was this piece missing at the
- [10:27] beginning of that process. So we we'd
- [10:29] run design sprints and they would be
- [10:30] helpful, but oftentimes it felt like
- [10:32] there was there was a a foundational
- [10:35] element of that project that we didn't
- [10:37] quite have our hands around. And it was
- [10:39] things like, you know, what is the
- [10:41] problem you're solving and who's the
- [10:42] who's the ideal customer? How are you
- [10:44] different than what's in the market
- [10:46] today? Who are your actual competitors?
- [10:48] And there were these questions that just
- [10:50] kept coming up again and again that led
- [10:52] us to say, hey, we need to create a new
- [10:55] sprint method, something that is really
- [10:57] targeted for the very beginning of these
- [10:59] big new projects. And and so that was
- [11:02] what led us to create the foundation
- [11:03] sprint um at Character Capital in 2021,
- [11:07] 2022.
- [11:08] Okay. Yeah. I was wondering the timeline
- [11:10] on this. What I love about stuff like
- [11:12] this, like episodes like this, is you
- [11:14] guys have done so much work and done
- [11:16] this so many times with so many
- [11:17] companies, so many founders, and have
- [11:19] learned what works and doesn't work. You
- [11:21] said hundreds of founders, hundreds of
- [11:23] startups, and you've just spent so many
- [11:25] hours studying this, refining it,
- [11:27] crafting it, and now you're just here to
- [11:29] share all the answers. Save us so much
- [11:31] time. Just like the ROI on this is
- [11:32] incredible for us. So, I appreciate you
- [11:34] guys doing this. Let's get into it.
- [11:36] Let's talk about the foundation sprint.
- [11:38] Uh, walk us through the process. How
- [11:40] does it start? What are the steps?
- [11:42] So, specifically what we talk about with
- [11:44] the foundation sprint is it's the very
- [11:46] beginning of your project. We recommend
- [11:49] this kind of crazy idea that you clear
- [11:51] your sk.
- [11:54] So, the core team, this is the
- [11:56] co-founders. If it's a startup, if it's
- [11:59] a product team inside a large
- [12:00] organization, it's the, you know, it's
- [12:03] whoever's in charge of product, it's
- [12:04] whoever's in charge of engineering, it's
- [12:06] whoever's in charge of design, it's
- [12:07] whoever's in charge of marketing. is the
- [12:09] core leadership team. They're going to
- [12:11] come together for it's going to be 10
- [12:13] hours roughly give or take. And during
- [12:16] those 10 hours, we're going to go
- [12:18] through a sequence of activities, very
- [12:20] highly scripted sequence of activities
- [12:23] so that we can make all of the key
- [12:24] decisions together and identify the
- [12:27] basics of the project, what what's going
- [12:29] to differentiate us in the marketplace
- [12:30] and what's the best approach or
- [12:32] implementation path. All of those
- [12:34] together form a hypothesis and then we
- [12:36] recommend so you finish. Now, that's
- [12:38] your foundation sprint. You've got your
- [12:39] founding hypothesis. Once you've got
- [12:41] that founding hypothesis, then you're
- [12:43] going to go and do design sprints. And
- [12:45] we recommend you clear the calendar for
- [12:47] two to three weeks at least, so you have
- [12:49] the chance to be wrong about your
- [12:51] hypothesis. And we're going to run
- [12:52] experiments. And again, the design
- [12:54] sprint, highly scripted, calendar, you
- [12:57] know, emails off. We're just Slack is
- [13:00] off. We're just focused on running
- [13:02] through these sequence of decisions,
- [13:04] building prototypes, getting them in
- [13:05] front of customers, learning about a
- [13:07] scorecard that relates back to the
- [13:08] founding hypothesis. So, at the big
- [13:10] picture, it's it's going to be anywhere
- [13:12] from 10 hours to, you know, three to
- [13:14] four weeks. You're going to run this
- [13:17] detailed script of activities with your
- [13:19] team with their calendars clear. And
- [13:21] that's crazy. And most people won't do
- [13:22] it. But if you do it, it confers upon
- [13:25] you a huge advantage because now you're
- [13:28] you're you've got information. You you
- [13:30] know whether or not your product clicks
- [13:32] with customers. And that's a we've seen
- [13:34] that be just such a tremendous signal
- [13:36] for is there going to be product market
- [13:37] fit.
- [13:38] Okay, that was really helpful. The 10
- [13:40] hours is that specifically that's the
- [13:42] foundation sprint time box.
- [13:43] That's the foundation sprint time box.
- [13:45] Yeah. And it's it's give or take, right?
- [13:46] It might you might go fast and be done
- [13:48] in in eight. You might have a lot of
- [13:50] conversations and have a slightly larger
- [13:51] team and might take you 12. So we like
- [13:53] to spread it out over two days. Do two,
- [13:55] you know, like four to six hour blocks.
- [13:57] Okay. And then the three to four
- [13:58] weeksish, that's including the design
- [14:00] sprint.
- [14:00] That's the design sprint. Yeah. One week
- [14:02] per sprint.
- [14:02] Okay. This is incredible ROI on 10 hours
- [14:05] of work. Uh basically over two days you
- [14:07] get to have a much stronger sense of
- [14:10] whether your idea is any good and you
- [14:13] can Yeah. That is that a simple way to
- [14:15] describe it like you just supercharge uh
- [14:17] validating an idea.
- [14:19] Exactly. Yeah. It's it's a it's a chance
- [14:21] to in the in the 10 hours it's a chance
- [14:24] to get clarity about the core of your
- [14:26] strategy which is something that teams
- [14:29] will often go months without really
- [14:31] nailing down. and the the three to four
- [14:35] weeks that's a chance to run experiments
- [14:38] and get confidence you're you're
- [14:39] actually building the right thing.
- [14:41] Okay, let's uh talk about these two
- [14:43] days. How does how do you lay it out?
- [14:44] How do you approach it? What should
- [14:46] someone do if they want to actually try
- [14:47] this at home?
- [14:48] So there are three phases to the
- [14:52] foundation sprint. First phase is the
- [14:54] basics. Second phase is differentiation
- [14:56] and the third phase is the approach to
- [14:59] the project. So again, all three of
- [15:01] those are going to come together to
- [15:02] create the founding hypothesis. So the
- [15:05] first phase, the basics as I mentioned,
- [15:07] that's identifying who's your customer,
- [15:10] what problem are you solving for the
- [15:12] customer, what's the competition for
- [15:15] solving that problem, how do they solve
- [15:16] it today, and what are the alternatives,
- [15:19] how how else do people solve this, what
- [15:21] are the workarounds?
- [15:23] Those are really almost embarrassingly
- [15:25] simple things to answer. But when we do
- [15:26] this with a team and everybody's
- [15:28] answering, you know, proposing their
- [15:30] answer to each question, we see
- [15:31] everybody's got a different perspective.
- [15:33] And then when we lock in the decision
- [15:35] maker on the team says, "Okay, it's
- [15:36] going to be this one. It's going to be
- [15:37] this one. It's going to be this one."
- [15:38] Now, we have clarity and and confidence
- [15:40] that that's the right way to go. So,
- [15:42] we'll move forward from the basics into
- [15:45] differentiation and identify what are
- [15:47] the things that can set us apart from
- [15:49] those competitors. And we're going to
- [15:51] use the advantages we have. We're going
- [15:52] to use our our insight. We're going to
- [15:54] use our motivation. and we're going to
- [15:56] use our special capabilities.
- [15:58] These are things again people are aware
- [16:01] of these things. They're in tune to it,
- [16:02] but we want to get super super specific.
- [16:05] And we'll go into an example in a second
- [16:07] and I think that'll make it more clear
- [16:09] exactly what we mean. But going then
- [16:10] from differentiation to saying what are
- [16:12] all of the different implementation
- [16:14] paths we could take here. Let's identify
- [16:16] what those are, put a little detail
- [16:17] behind them, and then we have a
- [16:19] structured path for people to take so
- [16:21] they can weigh that decision but move
- [16:23] through really quickly. commit to one,
- [16:25] have a backup plan in case you end up
- [16:28] feeling like you need to pivot once you
- [16:29] start sprinting on it. And all of that
- [16:32] together is going to form this this kind
- [16:34] of Mad Libs sentence. If we solve this
- [16:37] problem for this customer uh with this
- [16:40] approach, we think they're going to
- [16:41] choose it over the competitors because
- [16:42] of differentiator one and differentiator
- [16:44] 2. And it's it's almost silly how simple
- [16:48] this thing is, but really powerful if
- [16:51] for founders to have that that clarity
- [16:54] about, okay, here it all is in one
- [16:56] sentence. Now, let's go let's go test
- [16:58] and make sure this is true.
- [16:59] Amazing. Let's look at an example.
- [17:00] That's a really good idea. I know you
- [17:01] brought some some examples. You're going
- [17:03] to do some screen sharing. Uh you're
- [17:04] going to pull it up. If you're watching
- [17:05] on YouTube, you'll be able to see it.
- [17:07] Also, if you're watching on Spotify, you
- [17:08] can see the video. uh if you're an
- [17:10] Apple, sorry, but uh do your best to
- [17:13] describe what we're gonna be looking at.
- [17:15] Yeah. So, we're gonna talk about this
- [17:17] company called Latchet first. This is
- [17:19] the first company we'll talk about.
- [17:22] Latchet is a startup who was in our last
- [17:25] group of character labs and we can go
- [17:27] into to character labs later on but
- [17:29] essentially this is a kind of an
- [17:32] accelerator-l like program that we run
- [17:34] at Character Capital where we invest in
- [17:37] a a group of companies at the same time
- [17:38] and we run them through that process
- [17:40] that we were just describing where we
- [17:42] start with a foundation sprint and then
- [17:44] it's going to be a sequence of three
- [17:46] design sprints after that so that
- [17:48] they're they're testing and refining
- [17:50] that hypothesis And so it's a great time
- [17:52] for them. These are founders who have
- [17:53] just started their companies. They're
- [17:55] kind of, you know, that preede very
- [17:57] beginning zero stage. And the the
- [18:01] progress you can see in those three and
- [18:04] a half, four weeks, it's phenomenal. So
- [18:07] uh let's let's talk about Latchet. So
- [18:09] Latchet, a couple co-founders, Chris and
- [18:12] James, who were they had left Substack,
- [18:15] they were engineers leading up the
- [18:17] growth team at Substack, and they wanted
- [18:20] to build a product for for artisans. So
- [18:23] if you imagine like you're a you're a
- [18:25] jewelry maker, you're a you know uh
- [18:28] you're a painter, you're a woodworker,
- [18:30] and you want to sell your products
- [18:32] outside of your immediate you know,
- [18:34] community, the physical place where you
- [18:36] are, your physical location. Well, you
- [18:38] can, you know, you can build a site on
- [18:40] Shopify, but you still have to market it
- [18:42] if you do that. You got to figure out
- [18:44] how to reach those folks. You can put
- [18:46] your products on Etsy, but Etsy has
- [18:48] become quite commoditized. So, you're
- [18:50] going to be up against everybody
- [18:52] everywhere, and it's going to be very
- [18:54] hard for you to build an identity there,
- [18:56] like to build a sense of who I am, what
- [18:58] I'm all about.
- [19:00] And so what Chris and James thought was,
- [19:03] you know, maybe we could use some of the
- [19:04] the techniques and methods we we used at
- [19:07] Substack to help people find other, you
- [19:10] know, other newsletter writers through
- [19:12] their community, through recommendations
- [19:13] they make and and help help out artisans
- [19:16] in that way. Wouldn't that be cool? So
- [19:18] they were kind of at that stage. They
- [19:19] had a few different ideas about what
- [19:21] form that might take, what that might
- [19:23] look like when they joined Character
- [19:26] Labs. And so that's kind of the the
- [19:27] backdrop to to this little quick story
- [19:29] I'll tell.
- [19:30] And there's one really important thing
- [19:31] to emphasize about Chris and James that
- [19:34] Jake mentioned briefly, but I think is
- [19:36] is worth repeating, which is that
- [19:38] they're engineers. They are builders.
- [19:40] Their instinct is to write code. It's to
- [19:43] build software. And uh they actually
- [19:46] told us that they were excited but
- [19:48] nervous to come into character labs
- [19:51] where we would be encouraging them not
- [19:54] to write code right away to take this
- [19:56] time to clarify
- [19:58] the differentiation the the structure of
- [20:01] what they're building and to validate
- [20:03] that with customers before they went all
- [20:04] in on building a particular approach.
- [20:06] And I think you'll see in this example
- [20:08] how while they were a little hesitant to
- [20:11] do that upfront, eventually they saw how
- [20:14] much uh more valuable it was to work in
- [20:17] this way versus just diving right into
- [20:18] building something.
- [20:19] Uh that's actually really helpful
- [20:21] context and I speaking of the Substack
- [20:23] re recommendations feature was one of
- [20:25] the most game-changing features for me
- [20:27] with my newsletter. So uh because it
- [20:30] basically supercharged my growth. So, I
- [20:31] get why they'd be so excited about
- [20:33] bringing this learning to other to other
- [20:35] ideas and to their own startup. So,
- [20:37] thank you guys for doing that. And yeah,
- [20:39] I'm even more excited to see what
- [20:40] they're building. Well, let's take a
- [20:42] look. So, the this board here that we're
- [20:45] looking at, this is like their muro
- [20:46] board. So, we've got like a big template
- [20:48] and whether you're watching on YouTube
- [20:49] or listening to this episode, we'll
- [20:52] we'll talk about at the end how you can
- [20:54] get access to this template which will
- [20:56] kind of guide you through the process.
- [20:58] But what happens in this first step in
- [21:00] the foundation sprint in the basics as
- [21:02] you said before is that we're going
- [21:04] through a sequence of questions. Who's
- [21:07] the most important customer for example
- [21:08] is the first question the very first
- [21:10] question that a team needs to answer.
- [21:12] And as we do that just as an important
- [21:13] side note we're using this tactic that
- [21:15] we call work alone together. And
- [21:18] specifically the note and vote is this
- [21:21] method where everyone's in silence. You
- [21:23] know, in this case, both Chris and
- [21:24] James, but if you have a team of seven,
- [21:26] it's all seven people be working in
- [21:28] silence, writing down their own answers
- [21:30] to this question. Who's the most
- [21:32] important customer or who are all the
- [21:33] different kind of customers we might
- [21:35] consider? Writing down multiple answers
- [21:37] and then once we've got those answers,
- [21:40] the team's going to vote on those. and
- [21:42] then one person who's designated as the
- [21:44] decider. Usually it's going to be the
- [21:46] CEO of the startup, but it could be some
- [21:49] cases maybe it's the the you know chief
- [21:51] product officer whatever however they
- [21:53] decide to do it. But one person's going
- [21:54] to say okay this is our decision for now
- [21:56] and now we're going to move on. And by
- [21:58] doing this and using silence and using
- [22:01] structure and then having a designated
- [22:03] decision-making process, we can move
- [22:04] through a lot of conversations very
- [22:07] quickly and save some of that energy
- [22:09] that it requires to make decisions for
- [22:11] the decisions that matter most. In this
- [22:13] case, what we're really worried about on
- [22:16] day one of our foundation sprint is
- [22:18] differentiation. So, we don't want to
- [22:19] spend too long on the basics. Anyway, we
- [22:21] motor through customer problem, the
- [22:24] capability, the insight, the motivation
- [22:26] that the team has. Those are all
- [22:27] advantages. And who are the competition?
- [22:30] And we get this this sort of one-page
- [22:32] sheet, the basics, and it's going to
- [22:34] have the answers to all those questions.
- [22:36] Who's our customer? In this case,
- [22:37] artisans who want to sell online, but
- [22:39] they sort of find tech and marketing to
- [22:41] be hard. The problem is sales growth.
- [22:46] You know, if we if we jump down to the
- [22:47] competition, their number one competitor
- [22:49] is Shopify, but Etsy is another way
- [22:53] people approach this as we mentioned.
- [22:55] But there's also, you know, in-person
- [22:56] sales and art fairs or other ways that
- [22:58] people try to get at this problem. And
- [23:00] realistically, if you're delivering a
- [23:02] solution, you need to stand out from all
- [23:04] of those. And then there's their
- [23:06] advantages. We talked about, you know,
- [23:07] this this key one, they built Substacks
- [23:09] network growth features. So, they know
- [23:11] how to do this thing. So, now that we've
- [23:14] established the basics, we're going to
- [23:16] move on to differentiation. Before you
- [23:18] do that, actually, let me ask a question
- [23:20] here because I think people seeing this
- [23:22] could think, oh, this is like I know all
- [23:24] this stuff. so obvious like like it's
- [23:26] like okay I get I have an idea I don't
- [23:28] need to do this where do you find people
- [23:30] most are often surprised by something
- [23:31] that emerges out of this is like one of
- [23:33] these buckets often wow we this is often
- [23:36] not what you expected or is it generally
- [23:38] a lot of surprises what do you what do
- [23:40] you experience there
- [23:41] I think the moment where you immediately
- [23:44] start to see value is when everyone on
- [23:46] the team is writing down their answers
- [23:48] to these questions and then people put
- [23:51] their heads up and look at what everyone
- [23:53] else has written and they realize, oh,
- [23:56] that's not what I would have that's not
- [23:57] what I said or I didn't think of that
- [23:59] one or you know, gosh, the actual
- [24:03] concrete reality of going through with
- [24:06] the team and and being very transparent
- [24:08] and clear about how we're making
- [24:09] decisions too about each of these
- [24:11] things. When that basic sheet comes
- [24:14] together and you see the specifics, the
- [24:16] specifics are surprising, but it's also
- [24:19] familiar. we look at it and you say,
- [24:20] "Yeah, that looks that all looks right,
- [24:23] but I'm surprised by the specifics.
- [24:26] They're not what I would have written if
- [24:27] I had written it down. I might have
- [24:28] gotten two of those things, two of the,
- [24:30] you know, six items on there." And I
- [24:33] think that's what's that's what's most
- [24:34] surprising. It's and I think it's also
- [24:36] kind of a sense of relief that like,
- [24:38] okay, well, that's very reassuring that
- [24:40] we have we have clarity about that and
- [24:42] we've made it concrete. These activities
- [24:46] that we do during the basics are
- [24:48] impactful for different reasons. I think
- [24:51] that problem can be really interesting
- [24:54] because when teams sit down and think
- [24:56] about it, it is often less clear than
- [24:58] they thought that what the actual
- [25:00] problem is. Like wait, what problem do
- [25:03] our customers really have that we're
- [25:04] solving for them? I think competition
- [25:08] can be sort of an aha moment when uh
- [25:10] they start to think beyond just oh what
- [25:13] are the other startups in this space
- [25:15] like if this is an important problem
- [25:17] your customers probably already solving
- [25:19] it somehow it may be a workaround it may
- [25:21] be an alternative it may not be a direct
- [25:23] competitor but if it's worth solving
- [25:25] they probably have some way of dealing
- [25:27] with it today and what is that and when
- [25:29] you zoom out and you look at that set of
- [25:31] competitors it can be a little scary but
- [25:33] it it is also uh an important moment for
- [25:36] teams and then I think that advantage um
- [25:39] isn't necessarily immediately beneficial
- [25:42] but it becomes really valuable when the
- [25:45] teams are looking at differentiation
- [25:47] because you know startups can't compete
- [25:49] with big companies on scale or on you
- [25:53] know having built-in distribution
- [25:55] advantages or having partnerships in
- [25:57] place. So they really have to dig deep
- [25:59] and figure out what can we do that
- [26:01] nobody else is capable of doing. And so
- [26:04] by taking time to sit down and do this
- [26:06] almost unnatural act of like wait why
- [26:08] are we special and and you know certain
- [26:10] when we're able to encourage teams to
- [26:12] really think about that um it sets them
- [26:15] up really nicely for the next step which
- [26:16] is differentiation ideally based on
- [26:19] those advantages. What I'm hearing is a
- [26:21] lot of the value here is also just uh
- [26:23] this everyone has what the answers in
- [26:25] their head in some way but just seeing
- [26:28] what everyone else is thinking and then
- [26:29] aligning on one is is a lot of this
- [26:32] value. Yeah, it's like thinking deeply
- [26:35] and quietly about it yourself and then
- [26:37] seeing what everybody else comes up with
- [26:39] when they are able to also think deeply
- [26:41] and quietly about it. Um, and then you
- [26:45] know ideally if they're working you know
- [26:47] with us in character labs having
- [26:48] somebody who's a bit external to push
- [26:50] them and say like try harder like dig
- [26:53] deeper like what really makes you
- [26:54] special here? How are you really going
- [26:56] to beat open AI? How are you really
- [26:58] going to beat Google at this? This whole
- [27:00] idea of noting and voting and working in
- [27:01] silence such a recurring theme on this
- [27:03] podcast of not doing brainstorms in
- [27:05] large groups with a lot of people like
- [27:07] it feels like that's just dead in every
- [27:09] way. I just had this naming expert on
- [27:11] the podcast who names names some of the
- [27:13] biggest companies in the world. Pentium
- [27:15] Powerbook Sonos forcell and that's their
- [27:18] approach is they they used to do
- [27:19] brainstorms. He's like that doesn't
- [27:20] work. And now they just have small teams
- [27:22] sitting quietly in a room working
- [27:23] together on
- [27:24] on ideas and then thinking on their own.
- [27:26] So that's such an interesting trend.
- [27:27] Yeah. And I feel like IDO just like
- [27:29] created this whole we need to brainstorm
- [27:31] post-its and then everyone's like that's
- [27:33] not actually working. Let's stop doing
- [27:35] that. Um and the other thing that I feel
- [27:37] as you're talking through this like what
- [27:39] I'm feeling this is there's for founders
- [27:41] there's not like a manual for starting a
- [27:44] company. You always have it feels like
- [27:45] this dark art of like I guess I got to
- [27:47] find product market fit and this idea
- [27:49] feels like this is almost a manual of
- [27:51] the everything you need to do to just
- [27:53] get the basics of is this even worth
- [27:56] doing?
- [27:56] Yeah. And and that's why we created it
- [27:59] because we were we still are investing
- [28:01] in founders who are you know they're
- [28:04] they're incredibly talented and they're
- [28:05] smart and they have a background that is
- [28:07] going to give them an advantage in
- [28:08] building some particular product. But
- [28:10] you're right there's there's no manual
- [28:12] and we were just kind of solving our own
- [28:14] problem and you know we we believe in
- [28:17] this so much and we see the ROI as being
- [28:20] so great that this is the first thing we
- [28:22] do when we make an investment. you know,
- [28:24] we invest in a company and then we run a
- [28:26] foundation sprint with them right away.
- [28:28] We run more foundation sprints with
- [28:30] startups than we do design sprints at
- [28:32] this point. Um, and you know, I don't
- [28:34] think we can ever encapsulate every
- [28:36] single thing that you need to know or
- [28:37] that you need to do to start a company,
- [28:39] but this is our this is our best take at
- [28:44] like what you should do in the early
- [28:45] days to set yourself up for success and
- [28:48] maximize the chances that you're going
- [28:50] to reach product market fit.
- [28:52] Amazing. Okay, let's keep going. So,
- [28:53] we've done the basics. What comes next?
- [28:55] Yeah. So, we've done the basics and
- [28:57] another important thing that we've
- [28:58] accomplished while going through the
- [29:00] sequence of activities and the basics is
- [29:03] to boot up the right context into
- [29:06] everyone's head so that we're ready for
- [29:08] the main event of this first day, which
- [29:11] is differentiation. And I still have
- [29:13] very firmly in my mind, like I grew up
- [29:16] with a Mac plus computer and you'd put
- [29:18] in, you know, the disc and the drive and
- [29:20] you'd have to you'd have to boot up the
- [29:21] the app that you wanted to run. That
- [29:24] that's kind of the way our brains work.
- [29:25] Like we have limited working memory and
- [29:27] we've got to have the right stuff in
- [29:28] there when we're when we're going to
- [29:30] make a big decision. We're going to
- [29:32] think hard about a certain problem or
- [29:35] question. It's important to have the
- [29:36] right context fresh at hand. So the
- [29:39] basics is really the context for
- [29:41] thinking about differentiation and
- [29:43] differentiation is the heart of what
- [29:46] we're doing in the foundation sprint
- [29:48] because
- [29:49] it's it goes without saying perhaps but
- [29:52] we like to say it when you are making a
- [29:54] new product people want to ignore it.
- [29:57] People want to not pay attention to it.
- [29:59] And if they do have to pay attention to
- [30:01] it, if it gets in their face, they they
- [30:03] want to not try it because we just are
- [30:05] all bombarded by so many things and
- [30:07] that's never been more true than it is
- [30:09] now. And so we have defenses up to save
- [30:13] to save calories in our brain. We just
- [30:14] we don't want to engage. It's crucial
- [30:17] then that a product has a clear promise
- [30:20] that it makes and that that promise is
- [30:23] is radically differentiated from the
- [30:26] alternatives and that that promise is
- [30:28] strong enough that you'll try it and
- [30:30] then that the product delivers on that
- [30:32] promise. And so when we talk about
- [30:34] differentiation, we're saying look, we
- [30:36] want you to be really clear on your
- [30:38] promise. not the promise you're making
- [30:40] to investors about this technology and
- [30:42] what's special about the technology or
- [30:44] what's special about the market
- [30:45] opportunity, but with the customer at
- [30:47] the center. We've started the basics by
- [30:49] talking about the customer and the
- [30:50] problem they have and the way they see
- [30:52] the world. And we want to talk about
- [30:54] what you're going to offer to the
- [30:55] customer and how it's going to separate
- [30:57] from the alternatives. And so, in the
- [30:59] end of this next phase of the foundation
- [31:02] sprint, we're going to have a a 2 by two
- [31:04] diagram that's going to look like a
- [31:05] business school 101 diagram. And in
- [31:07] fact, we often refer back to this Steve
- [31:10] Jobs uh iPhone introduction slide where
- [31:13] he talks about the the iPhone and he
- [31:15] makes a joke about it. This is a
- [31:17] business school 101 diagram, but it's
- [31:19] really helpful to start developing your
- [31:21] product with this clarity about this is
- [31:23] the promise we'll make to customers at
- [31:24] the end and we're going to deliver on
- [31:25] that promise because we can test and
- [31:27] prove that in design sprints. So anyway,
- [31:31] we start off, we talk about
- [31:32] differentiators and we talk about
- [31:34] classic differentiators, fast to slow,
- [31:37] smart to not so smart to borrow from the
- [31:40] iPhone slide, easy to use to hard to
- [31:42] use, and so on. And we just start off
- [31:44] and have the team, okay, let's just
- [31:45] let's just score those up against the
- [31:47] competition. Put a sticky note on those
- [31:50] continuums showing where you think the
- [31:52] product could be. And usually you'll do
- [31:54] this and maybe you'll start to see,
- [31:55] well, there are a couple places where we
- [31:57] can stand out on these classics. That's
- [31:59] great. These classics are easily
- [32:01] understandable by any, you know, any
- [32:03] customer. We're all sort of familiar
- [32:05] with these kinds of things. So, okay,
- [32:06] that's great. Then we get into writing
- [32:09] custom differentiators. So, we're going
- [32:10] to write a bunch of, you know, good
- [32:12] things on one end, crummy opposite on
- [32:14] the other end, and then we're going to
- [32:16] score those. And so, for the latchet
- [32:18] story, we'll pick up with with Chris and
- [32:19] James here. You know, they've written,
- [32:22] well, we we could be uh really we could
- [32:25] really differentiate onworked versus
- [32:27] siloed. our approach isworked. If you're
- [32:29] using Shopify, you're you're siloed,
- [32:31] right? Or or we, you know, maybe maybe
- [32:33] we can differentiate on painless
- [32:34] business growth versus labor intensive
- [32:36] business growth. So that might be the
- [32:38] specific way we describe the promise of
- [32:41] our product. So after evaluating a bunch
- [32:43] of these, writing a bunch of these,
- [32:45] voting on them quietly, you know, and
- [32:47] then the decider is going to say, "All
- [32:48] right, I want to choose a couple of
- [32:50] these and we're going to try them out."
- [32:51] The teams are going to, if you're
- [32:53] running a foundation sprint, you're
- [32:54] going to try out a few differentiators.
- [32:57] You're gonna score against your
- [32:58] competitors. You're going to create a
- [33:00] scale. And you're gonna say, "Okay,
- [33:01] let's be honest. Let's be tough. Where
- [33:03] do we really think we could stack up
- [33:05] against the competitors on this
- [33:07] differentiator we've chosen?" In great
- [33:09] detail, plotting each each company or
- [33:12] product one at a time. Okay. So, you
- [33:14] know, you do that for one
- [33:15] differentiator, you do it for another.
- [33:17] You do it until you feel like we've got
- [33:18] two that are really strong. And then you
- [33:21] make that business school 101 diagram.
- [33:23] And so, you know, here's here's this one
- [33:25] for says Lyric. They changed their name
- [33:26] to Latchet. So I'm going to I'll edit
- [33:28] that real time.
- [33:29] I love this rebrand.
- [33:32] So yeah. So Latchets, you know, up here
- [33:34] in the top right corner and we say,
- [33:35] "Okay, look, this is a good
- [33:37] differentiation chart because you've got
- [33:38] this quadrant here, this quadrant here,
- [33:42] this quadrant here, right? You've got
- [33:43] the So you're in the top right and you
- [33:46] got to be in the top right. You always
- [33:47] got to be in the top right. Always have
- [33:48] to be top.
- [33:49] You always have to be in the top right.
- [33:50] And if you see those other three
- [33:52] quadrants, the the top left, the bottom
- [33:55] left, the bottom right, those form an
- [33:58] L-shape. And we call that loserville. So
- [34:00] we want to we want to have like a way of
- [34:02] looking at the world that puts all of
- [34:05] the competitors into Loserville. And
- [34:07] then we want to say like, okay, if you
- [34:09] can deliver on that and if that promise
- [34:11] is compelling to customers, so both
- [34:12] those things have to be true. Can you
- [34:15] deliver on it? And do customers care and
- [34:18] believe that that that matters to them?
- [34:20] If both of those things are true, you
- [34:21] have a really compelling promise. You
- [34:23] have the possibility of a very
- [34:25] successful product. So now we've
- [34:28] identified that and that's that becomes
- [34:30] a core of our hypothesis. Can we is that
- [34:32] differentiation true? So
- [34:36] that's the differentiation step. Uh
- [34:39] before you move on to the next step, is
- [34:40] that where you're going next? Just so I
- [34:42] could take a Yeah. Yeah.
- [34:43] Okay. Follow a couple threads. This is
- [34:44] so awesome. There's so many there's just
- [34:47] so much value here. Um, also just this
- [34:49] slide at the end here, if folks are
- [34:50] watching YouTube, this is like your deck
- [34:52] slide, right? Where you show Yeah. your
- [34:54] your competitors and how you're you're
- [34:56] better than them all.
- [34:57] Yeah. And actually, I want to jump on
- [34:59] that for a second because
- [35:00] we've all seen 2 by 2 diagram, right?
- [35:03] There's a ton of these. They're they're
- [35:04] all over the place. And if you're
- [35:07] anything like me, I just ignored these.
- [35:10] I just thought these were pretty much BS
- [35:12] up until like well whenever we started
- [35:15] running these foundations sprints three
- [35:16] or four years ago and I think the reason
- [35:19] why usually these these 2 by two
- [35:21] diagrams feel like this is just
- [35:23] consultant baloney this is just like who
- [35:25] you already know it's it's because you
- [35:28] know maybe one person makes this chart
- [35:30] and they do it quickly because they need
- [35:32] a slide for a slide deck and the
- [35:35] audience they're considering maybe it's
- [35:37] investors and so you know often these
- [35:39] describe technology or they describe the
- [35:41] market opportunity. They don't talk
- [35:42] about the customer's perspective. And
- [35:45] the other thing is that they're they're
- [35:46] not proven. There's no evidence behind
- [35:48] the fact that these are these true. So
- [35:50] if they are if they did happen to be
- [35:52] about customer perspective, it's
- [35:53] unlikely that the whole team would have
- [35:55] weighed in on on what those
- [35:57] differentiators are. And it's very
- [35:59] unlikely that we would have tested and
- [36:01] proven that that that matters and that
- [36:03] we can deliver on it. And so if you do
- [36:06] all of those things and you do it at the
- [36:08] beginning of the project, we think this
- [36:10] has the potential. We've seen it. It's
- [36:12] it becomes this well this guiding light.
- [36:15] Here's the north star. We need to
- [36:17] deliver on this. This is what we have to
- [36:19] create. And that helps you make
- [36:20] decisions all the way through your
- [36:22] product development cycle. Just to point
- [36:24] people to uh justification for why
- [36:27] differentiation is so important, there's
- [36:29] a couple episodes that I did that uh
- [36:31] I'll point to in the show notes. um that
- [36:34] just give you more context of why you
- [36:36] need to differentiate. So I spoke of uh
- [36:38] David Plac who is this naming expert
- [36:40] that we just had on the podcast. He his
- [36:42] whole thing is when he's coming up with
- [36:44] a name for like Sonos or Verscell or
- [36:46] Windsor if it's different it has to
- [36:48] differentiate and he talks about this in
- [36:50] depth. So we'll point to that episode if
- [36:52] you're and this is just like if you're
- [36:53] not convinced why are we spending so
- [36:54] much time on differentiation. Uh, also
- [36:55] April Dunford who's like the I don't
- [36:57] know the the the god of of of
- [37:00] positioning. She has differentiation is
- [37:03] such a core part of her approach to
- [37:05] positioning. And so there's just like so
- [37:07] much evidence to tell you that you
- [37:09] differentiation is a really important
- [37:10] step and element of successful
- [37:12] companies.
- [37:13] Yeah. One of the things that I've
- [37:15] noticed about these topics, the these
- [37:17] the basics we talked about already,
- [37:19] differentiation, this notion of you need
- [37:21] a foundation for your project, it's a
- [37:23] bit more under the radar for people. I
- [37:25] think it's a bit harder for people to
- [37:26] immediately see like, oh, we need this.
- [37:29] We see the people who react the
- [37:30] strongest to this and have the strongest
- [37:32] like immediate affinity to this idea
- [37:34] actually being you know startup founders
- [37:37] people who are really sophisticated like
- [37:38] in this challenge product managers who
- [37:41] are at you know we're uh uh invited in
- [37:45] to speak at openai and anthropic about
- [37:47] this and we see the product people there
- [37:49] being like oh my god this is this is
- [37:50] really powerful this is the kind of
- [37:51] stuff we need. I think for a lot of
- [37:53] folks though it can sound like ah this
- [37:55] is just elementary you know
- [37:57] differentiation of course we need to
- [37:58] differentiate. The problem is that all
- [38:00] this stuff gets backgrounded. It's it's
- [38:02] something we we've thought about a bit.
- [38:04] We assume we're on the same page. We
- [38:06] assume we're going to deliver something.
- [38:08] But then kind of business as usual
- [38:10] happens. We build a product. We get kind
- [38:12] of more interested in the technology and
- [38:14] delivering that and we end up trying to
- [38:16] sell it to customers at the end. We end
- [38:18] up putting a coat of paint on it with a
- [38:20] marketing page or sales deck. we haven't
- [38:22] actually built from the beginning the
- [38:25] thing that we know is going to matter to
- [38:26] people.
- [38:28] One of the most useful steps here that
- [38:30] uh I haven't seen before is just a
- [38:31] starting place for how to even start
- [38:35] thinking about differentiation. Like
- [38:36] everyone's always probably thinking
- [38:37] price and speed. Maybe you guys have a
- [38:40] really cool just starting list that you
- [38:41] showed here. Anything more you can add
- [38:43] here for helping people start to think
- [38:44] about ways to differentiate beyond the
- [38:46] obvious price and speed and I don't know
- [38:48] couple more. So, I'm just going to jump
- [38:50] into another startup here just so we can
- [38:53] see what this sheet looks like with
- [38:55] scores on it. So, this is a startup
- [38:57] called Melo. Anyway, the standard
- [39:01] classic differentiators where we start,
- [39:04] they are fast to slow, smart to not so
- [39:08] smart, easy to use to hard to use, free
- [39:11] to expensive, focused to
- [39:14] one-sizefits-all,
- [39:15] simple to complicated, and integrated to
- [39:18] siloed. And so, you know, there you
- [39:21] could probably argue there's these
- [39:23] others that should be included or some
- [39:25] of those should be taken off. But what
- [39:26] we like about this is that it's a small
- [39:29] set. They're easy to understand. We know
- [39:31] customers can understand these and they
- [39:34] create a great starting place for your
- [39:36] team to think about differentiation
- [39:38] because you can quickly look at this
- [39:40] list and start scoring where you think
- [39:43] your product could be on these scales.
- [39:45] And you know that if you can use one of
- [39:47] these, people will understand it. But it
- [39:49] also starts to make the team comfortable
- [39:51] with this notion of differentiation. And
- [39:54] again, we want to make differentiation
- [39:56] something that all of the co-founders or
- [39:58] all of the core team can participate in.
- [40:01] It's not just the job of the person
- [40:03] writing the pitch deck. It's not just
- [40:04] the job of the marketer or the
- [40:06] salesperson, but we're getting
- [40:07] everybody's
- [40:09] perspective in on it. And this is a
- [40:12] great warm-up activity before we start
- [40:13] to write our own custom differentiators.
- [40:17] Awesome. And then again, this is just
- [40:19] inspiration for coming up with more ways
- [40:21] to differentiate. Something that is a
- [40:23] common uh question I think for founders
- [40:25] is price as a differentiator. Is there
- [40:26] any insight you guys have there? Like
- [40:27] how often do you land on price being a
- [40:30] good differentiator with the startups
- [40:31] you work with? I think price is rarely
- [40:34] the the most important differentiator.
- [40:37] Part of what's interesting about going
- [40:39] through these classic differentiators,
- [40:40] these standard ones first, and then
- [40:42] jumping into the custom ones, is that
- [40:45] the classic ones are sort of universal,
- [40:48] but it is going to be hard to beat the
- [40:51] competition on very many of these. Like,
- [40:54] it's going to be hard to build a product
- [40:55] that's faster than what Google can build
- [40:58] or what OpenAI can build. It's going to
- [40:59] be harder to be cheaper than those
- [41:02] competitors because they just have so
- [41:03] many more resources. they can have lost
- [41:05] leader products that are that are
- [41:07] underpriced. Where I think pricing has
- [41:10] become a really clear advantage for some
- [41:13] companies is those that are leveraging
- [41:17] AI to solve problems that were
- [41:19] previously unsolvable with software. So
- [41:22] you know we have a company that we
- [41:24] invested in called bindwell and uh they
- [41:28] use AI to design precision pesticides
- [41:31] and uh we ran a foundation sprint with
- [41:33] them right after investing and you know
- [41:38] five years ago you couldn't design
- [41:39] pesticides with AI right it wasn't it
- [41:41] wasn't possible right if if you even if
- [41:43] you had that idea you wouldn't have been
- [41:44] able to build it and now you can and so
- [41:47] for them one of the big advantages is
- [41:49] like yeah these pesticides they can be
- [41:51] they can be a lot cheaper because it
- [41:52] doesn't require this like massive team
- [41:55] of you know R&D chemists to tinker and
- [41:58] experiment with things in the lab to try
- [42:00] to create new pesticides. We can design
- [42:02] them with AI. So it is it is more often
- [42:04] true in AI companies like that but it's
- [42:09] very difficult to to compete on price in
- [42:11] general and we think we find that it is
- [42:13] not as it's not as durable of an
- [42:15] advantage as some of these other things.
- [42:17] That is such a good point. Uh because
- [42:19] historically price has been a don't
- [42:21] don't compete on price for exactly what
- [42:23] you said. It's not it's hard to do long
- [42:25] term. It's kind of a race to the bottom
- [42:27] especially if there's incumbents. They
- [42:28] can price a lot lower. But with AI that
- [42:30] is a really often and strong
- [42:33] differentiator like now do this thing
- [42:35] like like cursor you basically is
- [42:37] competing on uh you know you're saving
- [42:39] engineering time and it's worth so much
- [42:42] money to you.
- [42:42] Yeah. At the same time, like the output
- [42:45] of the AI is probably not going to be
- [42:46] quite as good as a human process. So, it
- [42:49] can be a little bit cheaper. Yeah. For
- [42:51] now. But it has to be a lot cheaper. It
- [42:53] has to be, you know, I've heard people
- [42:54] offer 10x cheaper than the legacy sort
- [42:58] of um manual approach to solving that
- [43:00] problem as as a rule of thumb.
- [43:02] That's awesome. Okay. Uh I'll just
- [43:03] quickly reference there's an episode
- [43:05] that will come out before this with
- [43:06] Modavon about pricing strategy and
- [43:08] there's a lot of discussion actually on
- [43:09] this. Oh, great. especially with how to
- [43:11] design your price uh with customers as
- [43:13] you're starting a company. Also uh the
- [43:16] episode with uh the founder of
- [43:17] superhuman Rahul he actually spent
- [43:19] there's a lot of cool context on how he
- [43:21] differentiated superhuman and it was
- [43:23] actually very much on speed and is speed
- [43:25] actually yeah speed was where he landed
- [43:27] and to your point it was both it was the
- [43:28] vend diagram of what you said can we do
- [43:31] this and do people value it and that's
- [43:33] where his research pointed to is people
- [43:35] really value this and they were able to
- [43:37] achieve it. One of the things that's
- [43:38] really interesting about this example
- [43:40] here that we're looking at, Melo, is
- [43:42] that you can see that they were not the
- [43:45] best on all these scales. You know, it's
- [43:47] and if teams are going through and
- [43:49] they're being really realistic about how
- [43:50] they stack up against the competition,
- [43:53] it's normal and natural to find that
- [43:55] you're not going to be the best on all
- [43:57] these differentiators. And that is
- [44:00] really helpful for creating clarity in
- [44:01] your positioning and in your marketing
- [44:04] because you're not going to show a
- [44:05] featured checklist chart that you know
- [44:07] says you're better at everything than
- [44:09] every competitor. But if you can drive
- [44:11] home one or two things that your
- [44:13] customers really care about and that you
- [44:15] can be radically better at, um it's
- [44:18] going to improve your chances of of
- [44:20] winning and finding product market fit.
- [44:22] And and we find that going through this
- [44:24] process where you're not just thinking
- [44:25] about one differentiator at a time or
- [44:28] you're not trying to win on all of them,
- [44:29] but you're looking across this scale of
- [44:30] options and you're being just really
- [44:32] honest about where you stack up can both
- [44:35] point you in the right direction in
- [44:36] terms of what you will win on, but also
- [44:38] can give you the comfort to say, "Hey,
- [44:40] it's okay if we're not better than every
- [44:42] single company on every single one of
- [44:43] these things."
- [44:44] That's great context. That's going to
- [44:46] make people feel a lot better. I think
- [44:48] today's episode is brought to you by
- [44:50] KOD. I personally use Koda every single
- [44:53] day to manage my podcast and also to
- [44:55] manage my community. It's where I put
- [44:57] the questions that I plan to ask every
- [44:58] guest that's coming on the podcast. It's
- [45:00] where I put my community resources. It's
- [45:02] how I manage my workflows. Here's how
- [45:04] KOD can help you. Imagine starting a
- [45:07] project at work and your vision is
- [45:08] clear. You know exactly who's doing what
- [45:10] and where to find the data that you need
- [45:12] to do your part. In fact, you don't have
- [45:14] to waste time searching for anything
- [45:16] because everything your team needs from
- [45:18] project trackers and OKRs to documents
- [45:20] and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in
- [45:22] KOD. With Kod's collaborative all-in-one
- [45:25] workspace, you get the flexibility of
- [45:27] docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the
- [45:29] power of applications, and the
- [45:31] intelligence of AI, all in one easy to
- [45:34] organize tab. Like I mentioned earlier,
- [45:37] I use Kota every single day. And more
- [45:39] than 50,000 teams trust KOD to keep them
- [45:41] more aligned and focused. If you're a
- [45:43] startup team looking to increase
- [45:44] alignment and agility, Kota can help you
- [45:46] move from planning to execution in
- [45:49] record time. To try it for yourself, go
- [45:51] to kod.io/lenny
- [45:53] today and get 6 months free of the team
- [45:55] plan for startups. That's cooda.io/lenny
- [45:59] to get started for free and get six
- [46:01] months of the team plan. k cod.io/lenny.
- [46:03] io/lenny.
- [46:05] Anything else on differentiation before
- [46:07] we move on to the third step of
- [46:09] designing your approach?
- [46:10] I think it's worth taking a look at what
- [46:12] it looks like when you have a bunch of
- [46:14] sort of these customcraftrafted
- [46:17] differentiators. What that might look
- [46:18] like because in the case of Melo, we've
- [46:20] got I don't know there must be 25 here.
- [46:24] And you know, so they've written
- [46:26] purposeful, magical, clear, personal,
- [46:29] provides direction, flexible, human,
- [46:31] creative, beautiful, all kind and on and
- [46:33] on. What they're trying to get at and
- [46:36] what we want every team to sort of think
- [46:38] about here is what is a new version of
- [46:41] reality, a new lens that you can offer
- [46:43] to your customers on the world. Because
- [46:45] a lot of times you're building a new
- [46:47] product, you actually have to change the
- [46:49] way people think about what's possible
- [46:51] and what matters to them. Those classics
- [46:54] are often already well trotten ground
- [46:57] where other people have differentiated.
- [46:59] They've already thought about it. But
- [47:00] these these new particular things that
- [47:02] you know are are possible with your
- [47:04] technology that you know is possible
- [47:06] with the customer problem, the things
- [47:08] that you believe might matter. It's
- [47:09] really interesting to try some very
- [47:12] fine-tuned list of slight sometimes just
- [47:15] a slight variation. We we slightly
- [47:17] change this wording or the way we
- [47:18] describe what's great about what we do.
- [47:21] And that is the thing we think is really
- [47:23] going to stand out. And again, you can
- [47:24] see even on this list that they've
- [47:26] custom written, when we see where they
- [47:28] score it, they're not all the way to the
- [47:31] good end of the scale on all of them.
- [47:33] You know, when they get honest and look
- [47:34] through, they're like, well, actually,
- [47:36] you know, maybe we can't deliver on
- [47:37] this. But this one, we really can. And
- [47:39] this one we also suspect will matter to
- [47:41] customers.
- [47:43] Where did Melo land on the
- [47:45] differentiators they picked and where
- [47:46] did Latchet land?
- [47:47] Yeah, let's take a look. for Melo. They
- [47:49] tried out a bunch before they decided
- [47:52] here. So, they actually scored with the
- [47:54] competitors on these scales. And just
- [47:57] for context, Melo is a tool that allows
- [48:01] you to run very simple, very targeted,
- [48:05] very useful AI agents for common
- [48:08] everyday tasks like summarizing your
- [48:11] email or um uh cleaning up your calendar
- [48:14] or drafting responses to messages. And
- [48:17] one of their insights was that there's
- [48:19] been so many AI products that have
- [48:21] overpromised about being able to replace
- [48:24] all humans and do anything and you know
- [48:27] um 10x your productivity but so few of
- [48:30] them have actually delivered on those
- [48:32] promises. And so they have this insight
- [48:34] that if they can be really focused and
- [48:36] really human and really high quality and
- [48:39] they can deliver on that promise of, you
- [48:42] know, making your life better by
- [48:44] offloading
- [48:46] tedious tasks that that's going to
- [48:47] really click with with customers.
- [48:49] That's a great context. Thank you for
- [48:51] having that. So Melo lands on mobile
- [48:54] first and works out of the box with
- [48:56] their two differentiators and they're
- [48:58] trying to differentiate from know Gum
- [49:00] Loop and OpenAI is sort of a generalized
- [49:02] tool and Latchet they're going to
- [49:06] differentiate on
- [49:10] and we were pulling it up if folks
- [49:11] aren't watching he's pulling up the
- [49:12] mirrorboard
- [49:13] uh to show us where they landed.
- [49:15] Latchet they're going to differentiate
- [49:16] on helps you grow and cooperative. So
- [49:19] when they compare against Etsy, when
- [49:21] they compare against Shopify or setting
- [49:24] up your table at an art fair, they're
- [49:26] going to differentiate on helps you grow
- [49:28] in cooperative and they think none of
- [49:29] the competitors does both of those
- [49:31] things. Well, that is cool. Thank you
- [49:33] for sharing that. And to your point, the
- [49:35] this is where they think it will work.
- [49:36] And then the next step is actually test
- [49:38] this in the market, which is where we go
- [49:40] from here. Uh so let's move on to the
- [49:43] next step and which is the final step of
- [49:44] the foundation sprint.
- [49:45] Yeah. So closing off differentiation is
- [49:48] a short step that uh is just to create
- [49:51] some project principles that will help
- [49:53] you make decisions in line with that
- [49:55] differentiation. And you know you were
- [49:57] just talking about superhuman and
- [49:59] differentiating on speed. And when John
- [50:00] and I worked at Google back in the
- [50:02] 2000s, there was this list called 10
- [50:06] things we've found to be true. And one
- [50:08] of the things on that list was fast is
- [50:11] better than slow. And what was
- [50:13] interesting is this is a mantra that you
- [50:16] would actually hear people using in
- [50:17] meetings to help dictate decisions. You
- [50:19] know, well, we're considering this
- [50:22] approach to this view or this approach.
- [50:25] This approach renders, you know, 12
- [50:28] milliseconds faster. That's probably
- [50:31] going to be the one we're going to take.
- [50:32] There's going to be a really compelling
- [50:33] reason for us to not go with just the
- [50:35] one that renders faster or the one that
- [50:37] gets the user to their benefit with one
- [50:40] less click. And this notion that you can
- [50:43] have a a decision-making guide, we think
- [50:46] it we've seen it be so useful for uh for
- [50:49] us in those contexts. We think, hey,
- [50:51] this is an easy moment. You've got your
- [50:53] differentiators kind of loaded up in
- [50:55] your mind. Let's take a second here and
- [50:57] just think what's a principle? How can
- [50:58] we turn that into a principle? So, uh if
- [51:02] we take a look at, uh latchet, you know,
- [51:05] they've got help sellers help each
- [51:07] other. So, if they're trying to make a
- [51:08] decision between two approaches, well,
- [51:10] which one of these helps sellers help
- [51:12] each other? Or do the thing that makes
- [51:14] sellers more money? If we're choosing
- [51:15] between two things, let's do the one
- [51:17] that helps make them more money. And so,
- [51:19] we we then have we've kind of moved on.
- [51:22] We've got a mini manifesto we call it,
- [51:24] which is that differentiation chart and
- [51:26] these principles. And the notion is this
- [51:28] page, the the basics page was just kind
- [51:31] of the core simple stuff you need to
- [51:33] know about this project. The mini
- [51:35] manifesto in one page is your
- [51:37] decision-making guide.
- [51:39] This is so cool. And uh this looks like
- [51:42] it would take a lot of work, but again,
- [51:43] this is just uh a day or two of sitting
- [51:46] around working through this framework.
- [51:48] Yeah, you'll get to this in, you know,
- [51:50] fourish hours with your
- [51:52] Okay. By the end of the first day,
- [51:53] you'll have a mini manifesto that
- [51:55] describes how you win essentially as a
- [51:58] as a company and a startup.
- [51:59] Yeah. Or how you believe it's going to
- [52:00] work. And of course, we're going to test
- [52:01] it.
- [52:02] Yeah. Yeah. Now the next phase of the
- [52:03] foundation sprint is locking in on the
- [52:06] approach we're going to start with. So
- [52:08] we'll continue the story of Latchet here
- [52:10] to it's easier to use an example than to
- [52:13] describe this in the abstract. So coming
- [52:15] into Character Labs, Latchet had sort of
- [52:18] four approaches in mind, but they
- [52:19] weren't sure which one to take. So they
- [52:22] might build an app. That's one approach
- [52:24] they could take. They might build a sort
- [52:26] of a newsletter platform. That's
- [52:28] something obviously they knew how to do.
- [52:30] They might build a Shopify plugin.
- [52:32] That's a simple way to kind of piggyback
- [52:33] on something people are already doing.
- [52:35] They're right, their number one
- [52:36] competitor is Shopify. Or they might
- [52:39] have to build the full stack. And I
- [52:40] think a big question for them was which
- [52:42] of these and how much do we have to
- [52:44] build before there's enough value for
- [52:46] customers that they're actually going to
- [52:48] adopt it and we're actually going to get
- [52:49] some traction and get this thing going.
- [52:51] And it's important to call out here that
- [52:53] all four of these approaches solve the
- [52:55] same problem for the same customer and
- [52:58] they are all likely to differentiate
- [53:01] from the competition in the same ways
- [53:03] based on the unique advantages that the
- [53:06] founders Chris and James bring to this
- [53:08] company. So these are not like wildly
- [53:10] different product ideas or company
- [53:12] ideas. These are just different
- [53:14] approaches. You have the same
- [53:15] destination in mind, but you say, "Hey,
- [53:17] which path could we take?" It's like
- [53:19] pulling up directions on Google Maps.
- [53:20] This one's a little faster, this one
- [53:22] uses less fuel, this one avoids tolls.
- [53:25] Uh, what's the right approach for us to
- [53:27] take?
- [53:27] And I love that the what you the work
- [53:29] you did on that first day eliminates a
- [53:30] lot of ideas you probably had that you
- [53:33] would have probably spent time building
- [53:34] and then realizing, okay, this doesn't
- [53:35] make any sense. It's just like what
- [53:36] everyone else has.
- [53:38] Totally. Totally. Yeah. And we usually
- [53:42] see teams starting projects in one of
- [53:44] two states. And one state is the state
- [53:48] that Latchet finds themselves in where
- [53:50] gosh there's a few different ways we
- [53:51] could do this. How do we decide? We can
- [53:54] discuss and discuss and discuss but you
- [53:56] know that could go on forever. So that's
- [53:58] state one. We we know there are some
- [54:00] options. And state two is we're pretty
- [54:03] locked in on one approach already. We we
- [54:05] think we've got this figured out. In
- [54:08] either of those cases, we think it's
- [54:10] worth taking again like about, you know,
- [54:12] four hoursish to be really careful to
- [54:17] lay out the options. If you think
- [54:18] there's only one option to sort of force
- [54:20] yourself to think, well, what if this
- [54:22] doesn't work? What's another
- [54:23] alternative? Or is there another
- [54:24] alternative that we have previously
- [54:26] considered and dismissed that we should
- [54:29] maybe reconsider just to make sure? And
- [54:32] end with a situation where you've made a
- [54:34] decision clearly about, okay, we've
- [54:36] considered alternatives. this is our
- [54:38] first choice and you've also identified
- [54:40] this is our backup plan so that failure
- [54:43] doesn't seem quite so scary when we
- [54:45] start to run experiments and we're
- [54:47] really able to to pivot fast if should
- [54:50] that happen.
- [54:52] So what we're going to do on the second
- [54:54] day of the foundation sprint or this
- [54:56] sort of third phase which is the
- [54:59] approach is to identify those different
- [55:02] paths. So for latchet here they've got A
- [55:05] C and D options. We're going to color
- [55:07] code those and then we're going to plot
- [55:09] them on these charts. So, we've got
- [55:11] these different lenses. We call this
- [55:13] activity magic lenses. And the notion is
- [55:15] if we had a discussion about it and we
- [55:17] could as investors if we could imagine
- [55:20] like waving a magic wand and putting the
- [55:22] perfect team of adviserss in place to
- [55:24] counsel the founders on this decision.
- [55:27] We would love for them to have a
- [55:29] customer expert, somebody who's just,
- [55:32] you know, brilliant vision for the
- [55:33] product and the customer experience. And
- [55:36] they're, you know, hammering their fist
- [55:37] on the table saying the customer, the
- [55:39] customer, the customer, make the
- [55:40] decision that's best for the customer.
- [55:42] And so we'll plot those options on these
- [55:45] axes of easy to use versus hard to use
- [55:48] and perfect solution to the customer
- [55:50] problem versus, you know, this is just
- [55:51] an okay solution to the customer
- [55:53] problem. And then similarly, we want
- [55:55] some an adviser who's going to pound
- [55:57] their fist on the table for building
- [56:00] something cheap and fast, getting it out
- [56:01] into the market, being pragmatic, get it
- [56:03] out there as fast as possible. That's
- [56:04] the pragmatic lens. We want somebody
- [56:07] who's going to advocate for growth.
- [56:08] What's the way to reach the most
- [56:10] customers, get it in people's hands as
- [56:12] fast as possible, easy to adopt. We want
- [56:14] somebody who's going to advocate for for
- [56:16] money, for the financial health of the
- [56:18] business. So, what's going to create
- [56:20] long-term value for the customers?
- [56:22] where's where's there the biggest
- [56:23] audience of these folks? We want to look
- [56:26] at differentiation which we spent you
- [56:28] know the first half of the foundation
- [56:30] sprint establishing. Well, we want to
- [56:31] consider these approaches through that
- [56:33] lens as well. And so what the teams will
- [56:36] do is to plot these options on these
- [56:38] lenses. They'll almost always create
- [56:40] some lenses of their own, some custom
- [56:42] lenses that matter to them. You know,
- [56:44] they might have one about their
- [56:45] conviction. Um I think there's a there's
- [56:48] sort of a humorous one for mellow where
- [56:50] it's like which you know founder is like
- [56:53] f yeah it's exactly what I want to what
- [56:55] I want to build and on the other end of
- [56:58] the spectrum it's like you know nah just
- [57:00] kind of the the sort of heat of
- [57:02] excitement that you feel that might be a
- [57:03] really important decision
- [57:04] that feels really important like that
- [57:06] feels like that should be one of your
- [57:07] you call these the magic lenses.
- [57:08] Yeah it probably should be it probably
- [57:10] should be
- [57:11] like how excited are you to build this
- [57:13] feels like a really important piece.
- [57:14] Yeah, we saw that one in this is the our
- [57:17] cohort of labs that's going on right
- [57:18] now. And I'll bring that one that one up
- [57:20] for um for context.
- [57:22] If we add it, we can call it the Lenny
- [57:24] Lens.
- [57:24] The Lenny Lens. Yeah. Oh, that's a good
- [57:26] idea.
- [57:27] So, yeah. So, here it is.
- [57:29] And um you can see that Marie is more
- [57:32] likely to swear than than Ben
- [57:34] apparently. But the that it's it's
- [57:36] crucial, right? And many founders,
- [57:38] they'll have different one of the
- [57:39] challenges is that for each founder, I
- [57:41] think each set of founders, there's
- [57:43] maybe a different way that they phrase
- [57:45] what that means, what conviction means
- [57:46] to them. And sometimes, and maybe it's
- [57:49] as simple as this. It's just I just feel
- [57:51] it. I just know. And sometimes it's a
- [57:52] little bit more like, well, I, you know,
- [57:54] it's it's a it's conviction, but it's
- [57:56] also what's the data that we have behind
- [57:59] it? And and that's what forms my my
- [58:01] intuition about it.
- [58:03] Awesome. I I I love that lens. I love
- [58:05] that you're asterric out so it's not a
- [58:08] little bit little just slightly
- [58:10] concealed
- [58:11] slightly
- [58:12] that's the part yeah if you zoom in it's
- [58:14] it's actually uh not censored so the
- [58:18] cool thing about this lens's thing is at
- [58:20] the end you've done all that you've
- [58:22] plotted it all out and if you're having
- [58:24] a conversation like that you just have
- [58:25] to sort of maintain in memory what did
- [58:27] that person say what did that other
- [58:28] person say what's that conversation I
- [58:30] had you know a week ago whatever here
- [58:33] it's all laid out And sometimes you zoom
- [58:36] out and it's honestly as simple as like,
- [58:38] oh, hey, look, you know, the the blue
- [58:40] one is in the top right quadrant of
- [58:42] almost every single lens. Like what what
- [58:45] is that one? What's going on? That might
- [58:47] just be an easy decision. Sometimes you
- [58:50] zoom out and you say, "Oh, clearly like
- [58:52] nothing wins in every lens." And that's
- [58:55] actually really reassuring because then
- [58:56] you know there is no perfect decision.
- [58:58] There's nothing that checks all the
- [59:00] boxes. And that's going to help us
- [59:02] decide because now we decide which is
- [59:05] the most important lens, which is the
- [59:07] most important viewpoint to take. And
- [59:10] you can you can actually move forward in
- [59:12] either either way, either situation you
- [59:14] get in where there's sort of consistency
- [59:16] across all the lenses or there's not.
- [59:20] You either pick a lens or you just pick
- [59:22] the the consensus winner.
- [59:24] I love that this step answers a question
- [59:26] that's been in the back of my mind that
- [59:28] I think a lot of people wonder as
- [59:30] they're hearing this is just why don't I
- [59:31] just build something and launch it and
- [59:33] learn and like what am I spending all
- [59:35] this time sitting in a room and this is
- [59:38] and this to me is a big part of the
- [59:39] answer is just like spending an hour or
- [59:42] two thinking through here's the ideas we
- [59:44] have how do they compare on the how do
- [59:47] they look on these magical lenses which
- [59:49] makes so much sense like how do they
- [59:51] just filter on what customers will love
- [59:52] most will help us grow the fastest, will
- [59:55] drive the most money, things like that.
- [59:56] Like, it's such a simple, quick exercise
- [59:59] that will save you so much time building
- [01:00:01] and launching and having to spend time
- [01:00:03] learning. Like, that is weeks, days,
- [01:00:05] months of work versus a couple hours
- [01:00:07] could save you so much of that time.
- [01:00:10] And it's also the case that you start
- [01:00:12] building something, it's exciting, you
- [01:00:14] can move fast, it's easy to easier and
- [01:00:17] easier to see progress now with AI
- [01:00:20] tools. And that act of building and
- [01:00:23] starting to create something has a
- [01:00:27] momentum of its own that can be hard to
- [01:00:30] stop. And if you're headed in the wrong
- [01:00:31] direction, you can spend a lot of time
- [01:00:34] building and making progress, but it's
- [01:00:36] just if it's not progress in the right
- [01:00:38] direction, it's it's actually hurting
- [01:00:40] you. And that's why we we want people to
- [01:00:43] pause and and take this. It's really the
- [01:00:46] as you said earlier the ROI is high but
- [01:00:50] it feels very unnatural to pause when
- [01:00:52] you're so excited at the beginning and
- [01:00:54] ready to go to pause and say okay let's
- [01:00:56] make sure we're taking the right path
- [01:00:58] but you know you just imagine you're you
- [01:01:00] know you're Gandalf you're Frodo you're
- [01:01:03] starting off you're trying to get to
- [01:01:04] Mordor it's a long trip you don't want
- [01:01:06] to take the wrong path you want to take
- [01:01:08] the you know think before you start
- [01:01:10] marching through you know the the swamps
- [01:01:12] or whatever
- [01:01:13] one phenomenon we've seen when teams are
- [01:01:16] building things really quickly with AI
- [01:01:18] is that the more AI generated or
- [01:01:21] assisted they are the more generic they
- [01:01:23] tend to turn out which makes sense if
- [01:01:25] you think about how LLMs were developed
- [01:01:27] you know they're all basically
- [01:01:28] pre-trained on the same data and so in
- [01:01:30] this excitement and this rush to say wow
- [01:01:32] look at how fast we can build it you
- [01:01:34] actually end up with something that is
- [01:01:36] less differentiated than what already
- [01:01:38] exists in the world and then you know
- [01:01:41] let's say you launch it and that you
- [01:01:42] know takes longer than building sort a
- [01:01:44] clickable prototype, but you launch it
- [01:01:46] because you're moving so fast. And then
- [01:01:48] you get data from the people who managed
- [01:01:50] to find that thing about what they did
- [01:01:53] with it, but you don't get any data
- [01:01:55] about what they didn't do with it. And
- [01:01:57] you certainly don't get any data about
- [01:01:59] the people who never found it, who
- [01:02:00] never, you know, tried it. Maybe they
- [01:02:02] landed on your website and they're like,
- [01:02:03] blah, another like another generic AI
- [01:02:07] generated thing. Like it's that's not
- [01:02:09] worth my time. And so, uh, we think it's
- [01:02:11] really helpful to basically put yourself
- [01:02:14] in a situation where you can slow down a
- [01:02:17] little bit and do some like some some
- [01:02:19] hard thinking, some deep thinking about
- [01:02:21] what's actually going to make your
- [01:02:22] product unique and then you can switch
- [01:02:24] into this mode of like, okay, great.
- [01:02:26] Now, let's go as fast as possible and
- [01:02:28] get that out into customers hands. But,
- [01:02:31] um, if you don't take this step first,
- [01:02:34] it's actually kind of counterintuitive
- [01:02:35] that going fast can actually slow you
- [01:02:38] down in the long run. Yeah. To build on
- [01:02:40] that, I had this guest recently, Bob
- [01:02:42] Baxley.
- [01:02:43] Yeah.
- [01:02:44] Bob.
- [01:02:44] Okay. So, he has this really interesting
- [01:02:47] insight. He calls uh he calls it I think
- [01:02:50] he calls it the primal mark.
- [01:02:52] Essentially, his feedback is wait as
- [01:02:54] long as possible to start any sort of
- [01:02:56] sketch or prototype because as soon as
- [01:02:58] you start drawing what you're building
- [01:03:01] it now everything you do will be a
- [01:03:02] response to that.
- [01:03:04] And so the more time you can spend
- [01:03:06] before starting to concept out the
- [01:03:08] solution, the more likely are to land on
- [01:03:10] something that works.
- [01:03:12] Yeah, that is super interesting. And uh
- [01:03:15] you know it's
- [01:03:16] counterintuitive.
- [01:03:17] Yeah. And I find myself challenged to
- [01:03:19] think about it in the context of the
- [01:03:21] sprints that we run with founders. But I
- [01:03:24] think one way to interpret that in in
- [01:03:27] the work that we do is that we used to
- [01:03:29] just run design sprints with with every
- [01:03:31] team. like that was our hammer and and
- [01:03:34] you know everything looked like a nail.
- [01:03:35] And part of what we found so valuable
- [01:03:37] about doing the foundation sprint is
- [01:03:39] that it it keeps you away from ideiation
- [01:03:42] for just a little bit longer and it it
- [01:03:45] forces you to think about, you know, why
- [01:03:48] you're unique and and the market that
- [01:03:50] you're going into before you get to that
- [01:03:53] moment of creating something that looks
- [01:03:55] realistic and then maybe being a little
- [01:03:57] bit locked into to that approach. That's
- [01:04:00] such a like I love that that this
- [01:04:02] emerged out of that like you guys are
- [01:04:04] were so design sprint oriented and it's
- [01:04:07] just like cool let's just make prototype
- [01:04:08] let's design let's make it real let's
- [01:04:10] show people and that's like I think
- [01:04:12] where a lot of people's minds are at
- [01:04:14] more and more or and maybe as a result
- [01:04:16] and then this is almost like a okay
- [01:04:18] maybe that wasn't the right approach to
- [01:04:19] start maybe it's actually better to
- [01:04:21] think a little bit of what we want to
- [01:04:23] design and build before and so just the
- [01:04:25] fact that you guys spent so much your
- [01:04:26] life and time on that and then realize
- [01:04:29] this is actually potentially even more
- [01:04:31] important to do. Uh is it says a lot.
- [01:04:33] Well, and I ideas always get distilled
- [01:04:36] down to like one thing that people grab
- [01:04:39] on to and they they focus on. And I
- [01:04:41] think with the design sprint, it got
- [01:04:43] distilled down to just build a prototype
- [01:04:47] like just just quit messing around and
- [01:04:49] build something. But you know, the
- [01:04:51] reality is when you run a design sprint,
- [01:04:52] it's five days and you don't build the
- [01:04:54] prototype until the fourth day, right?
- [01:04:56] So you do you do a bunch of work to
- [01:04:58] figure out um you know what is uh how
- [01:05:01] does our customer learn about this
- [01:05:02] thing? um you know what are the
- [01:05:04] different ideas that we're bringing to
- [01:05:06] what our solution could look like which
- [01:05:08] of those are the most likely to work and
- [01:05:10] only then at the end of the week are you
- [01:05:12] building a prototype but I do think that
- [01:05:14] as the that method has become really
- [01:05:17] widely known uh people just think about
- [01:05:19] the you know let's build something and
- [01:05:21] then once you multiply that times the
- [01:05:23] the power of AI it definitely creates
- [01:05:25] this narrative that the the only way to
- [01:05:28] build something new is to just create
- [01:05:31] the product as quickly as possible
- [01:05:33] and that that doesn't really match our
- [01:05:36] experience, you know, that doesn't
- [01:05:37] really kind of fit the pattern of what
- [01:05:39] we've seen working best across the few
- [01:05:42] hundred companies that we've worked
- [01:05:43] with. I think this validates in some
- [01:05:46] ways the uh role of a product manager
- [01:05:50] where the PM's job is to help the team
- [01:05:52] figure out what should we be building
- [01:05:54] and are we all aligned on what we're
- [01:05:56] building before we start designing and
- [01:05:57] building. And uh so this is almost like
- [01:06:00] like this process is almost like the
- [01:06:02] product requirements document of a of a
- [01:06:04] company uh which I think a lot of
- [01:06:07] product people listening to this will
- [01:06:08] feel really good about. Yeah, we see
- [01:06:10] this as a great tool for product people.
- [01:06:12] It's a way to
- [01:06:15] give you a structure for leading your
- [01:06:17] team through those decisions and a way
- [01:06:20] to give the all the folks on the team
- [01:06:24] including the the person who's the the
- [01:06:26] product leader but the person who's the
- [01:06:28] engineering leader, the person who's the
- [01:06:30] marketing leader, the sales leader, the
- [01:06:32] design leaders. The exact right
- [01:06:35] opportunity to contribute and
- [01:06:37] participate in forming the strategy. the
- [01:06:40] exact right opportunity as we get into
- [01:06:42] design sprints following the foundation
- [01:06:43] sprints to then make it real and you
- [01:06:46] know turn that that idea that hypothesis
- [01:06:50] about what might work into hopefully
- [01:06:53] evidence that it does work. I feel like
- [01:06:55] it's actually more helpful than to
- [01:06:57] engineers like non-product people
- [01:06:59] because I think a PM brain would be like
- [01:07:01] I want to do this uh intuitively whether
- [01:07:04] they do it right or not. I think it's
- [01:07:06] other functions almost that are like no
- [01:07:07] just jump jump straight to design
- [01:07:09] straight to prototyping. Let me ask you
- [01:07:11] uh like while we're on this tangent
- [01:07:13] we're on this wild tangent out of this
- [01:07:14] process but I want to uh this question
- [01:07:16] has been in my mind
- [01:07:19] because I recently had a founder on the
- [01:07:20] podcast uh uh Mayor who built this
- [01:07:23] company called base 44. He built it. It
- [01:07:25] sold in six months for $80 million two
- [01:07:27] weeks.
- [01:07:28] And this journey of that is he just had
- [01:07:30] a problem he wanted to solve for himself
- [01:07:32] for his girlfriend for a scouts program.
- [01:07:34] He built it, people started using it and
- [01:07:36] he kind of evolved it from there. And
- [01:07:39] obviously he didn't go through a process
- [01:07:40] like this. Thoughts on just like is it
- [01:07:43] okay to just do that? When should
- [01:07:45] someone think about okay, I should
- [01:07:47] actually set aside time to do a
- [01:07:49] foundation sprint versus like I'm just
- [01:07:50] motivated to solve a problem for my
- [01:07:52] friends. I'm just going to build it,
- [01:07:54] evolve it, iterate with them, and kind
- [01:07:56] of go from there.
- [01:07:58] One of the observations from our
- [01:08:02] hundreds of experiences
- [01:08:04] working alongside founders in the early
- [01:08:06] days of their projects and watching them
- [01:08:09] make decisions and watching them try
- [01:08:12] things and succeed or fail is that there
- [01:08:15] are so many founders who are incredibly
- [01:08:19] bright, incredibly capable. They have
- [01:08:23] great insights about the market, about
- [01:08:25] an opportunity, and yet their startup
- [01:08:28] does not work out. And we there's a a
- [01:08:32] problem with selection bias that we, you
- [01:08:34] know, we we hear from the folks who they
- [01:08:37] were brilliant. They were, you know,
- [01:08:39] they checked all those boxes I just
- [01:08:41] described. They saw a great opportunity.
- [01:08:43] They they were smart. They they executed
- [01:08:45] well, they had courage and conviction,
- [01:08:47] and they did it. And it worked out. And
- [01:08:49] it was a tremendous success. And I I
- [01:08:52] think that the danger in thinking like
- [01:08:54] well they didn't follow a process so I
- [01:08:56] don't need to and you know that may be
- [01:08:58] true and you know that's that maybe
- [01:09:00] maybe you don't need it but what we
- [01:09:03] believe is you have a better this just
- [01:09:05] increases your odds this is a chance to
- [01:09:07] to get more clear on is this a good
- [01:09:10] opportunity to get more clear on will
- [01:09:12] the thing I build click with customers
- [01:09:14] and you know if you've already figured
- [01:09:17] out that no this things my my product
- [01:09:20] has taken off my product is working.
- [01:09:21] We've actually had founders in labs who
- [01:09:24] while they started off Character Labs
- [01:09:26] and they said, you know, I started
- [01:09:28] selling this thing and it's already
- [01:09:30] taking off. I want to stop running
- [01:09:32] experiments. And we're like, yeah, stop
- [01:09:33] running experiments. You don't need to
- [01:09:35] do this. If you've got product market
- [01:09:36] fit, if you've got evidence that this
- [01:09:38] thing is clicking and you're you have
- [01:09:40] conviction, run with it. But if you're
- [01:09:43] not there, this is a great path to get
- [01:09:46] you going. And if you're not sure if the
- [01:09:49] thing you're going to build is going to
- [01:09:50] turn into that, you know, $80 million
- [01:09:52] exit in, you know, in 6 months, we
- [01:09:55] believe this is a good chance to improve
- [01:09:57] your odds. People hearing this might be
- [01:10:00] feel like I haven't heard of any company
- [01:10:03] doing this that has become a trillion
- [01:10:05] dollar IPO success. Uh what what would
- [01:10:08] make me believe that this is a the
- [01:10:10] process I should follow versus just I'm
- [01:10:12] just going to do what I hear on YC, just
- [01:10:14] build it, launch it, iterate, that kind
- [01:10:16] of thing. What can you share to get
- [01:10:17] people confidence this is the approach
- [01:10:19] to take?
- [01:10:20] Well, the first thing I'd say is give us
- [01:10:21] some time. We're we're pretty new to
- [01:10:24] this. We started Character Labs about
- [01:10:26] three years ago. We created the
- [01:10:27] foundation sprint about three years ago.
- [01:10:30] But more seriously, when we were
- [01:10:32] creating this method, one of the things
- [01:10:34] that we did was look back across all the
- [01:10:36] projects we've been involved in and the
- [01:10:38] ones that were really successful and we
- [01:10:40] looked for patterns. And while those
- [01:10:42] teams didn't have the foundation sprint,
- [01:10:45] they ended up having really clear
- [01:10:48] differentiation and a really clear view
- [01:10:50] of what made them unique that they were
- [01:10:53] able to build on. And as we ran design
- [01:10:54] sprints with them, we were able to sort
- [01:10:56] of uh test and validate against that
- [01:10:58] differentiation. Um, so we believe that
- [01:11:01] this is sort of a key to success even if
- [01:11:04] those teams didn't have access to this
- [01:11:05] exact same methodology. So what I'm
- [01:11:07] hearing is this is essentially like
- [01:11:09] alpha in uh starting a company. This is
- [01:11:12] a new process that companies are just
- [01:11:14] starting to use. You guys are working
- [01:11:15] closely with founders and it's rooted in
- [01:11:19] the success of many many many companies
- [01:11:22] that you guys were involved in early on
- [01:11:23] and continue to be involved in. Yeah.
- [01:11:26] It's based off of this thing we've seen
- [01:11:28] again and again in the most successful
- [01:11:30] projects when we're inside the room in
- [01:11:33] the early days and we're seeing people
- [01:11:35] make decisions. this is what drives
- [01:11:37] those decisions. It's differentiation.
- [01:11:39] And so if we look back across, you know,
- [01:11:42] all of the sprints that we've been a
- [01:11:44] part of over the the years and John and
- [01:11:46] I have been inside lots of these rooms,
- [01:11:50] lots of these conversations.
- [01:11:51] And if you're not watching on YouTube,
- [01:11:52] by the way, there's a cool visual that
- [01:11:53] uh that Jake is showing. Yeah, it spans
- [01:11:56] across Google, Google Ventures,
- [01:11:58] Character Capital, and if you're
- [01:11:59] watching on YouTube, you'll see all
- [01:12:00] these little white circles, and each one
- [01:12:02] sort of represents, you know, a company
- [01:12:04] that we've seen inside of during these
- [01:12:06] design sprints. And there are a lot of
- [01:12:10] really great success stories in there.
- [01:12:11] You know, we've had the chance to I
- [01:12:13] mentioned the story of Google Meet and
- [01:12:15] being there and figuring out what is it
- [01:12:17] that's going to make those things stand
- [01:12:18] out. That was what made the project
- [01:12:21] finally start to take off and to this
- [01:12:23] day is still sort of what animates it
- [01:12:26] being inside of, you know, the early
- [01:12:28] days of what became Google Photos or
- [01:12:30] Google Trips and and some of the early
- [01:12:32] design sprints and there's there are a
- [01:12:33] lot of others on here. But honestly, of
- [01:12:36] course, we've also seen inside a lot
- [01:12:38] that that didn't work out. If we looked
- [01:12:41] inside the greatest hits though, the
- [01:12:44] real smash successes, we looked inside
- [01:12:47] all of those, we realized there is a
- [01:12:49] common element and that common element
- [01:12:51] in all of them is differentiation. That
- [01:12:54] there was clarity around this is what
- [01:12:56] we're trying to prove to customers. This
- [01:12:58] is the promise we're making. And so we
- [01:12:59] we've been on those teams or we've
- [01:13:01] worked alongside those founders who have
- [01:13:04] this clear idea of differentiation and
- [01:13:06] sometimes they're not right. They run
- [01:13:08] the experiments and they change it. But
- [01:13:10] the thing is they're keyed into
- [01:13:12] differentiation as being crucial.
- [01:13:13] They're not just thinking about the
- [01:13:15] product and trying to get the right
- [01:13:17] shape of the product or trying to make
- [01:13:18] it, you know, usable or whatever.
- [01:13:20] They're really keyed in on
- [01:13:21] differentiation and how do we find the
- [01:13:23] right promise and deliver on that
- [01:13:25] promise and express that promise to
- [01:13:27] customers. So to explain a little bit
- [01:13:29] quickly of what I mean by
- [01:13:30] differentiation and how this has
- [01:13:32] manifested in products we've seen. If
- [01:13:34] you go back to the early days of Gmail
- [01:13:36] in the 2000s, you know, if you had
- [01:13:38] email, you were probably using Hotmail
- [01:13:40] or Yahoo and it worked fine and you
- [01:13:41] didn't have to think about it and this
- [01:13:43] new product comes along and you're like,
- [01:13:44] "God, I'm not going to want to switch my
- [01:13:46] email address. What a hassle. Who wants
- [01:13:49] to do that?" You no one. Gmail's promise
- [01:13:51] was, "Hey, massive storage, great
- [01:13:54] search." And as we were building the
- [01:13:57] product out and you know marketing and
- [01:14:00] explaining it to people and making
- [01:14:01] decisions inside the project, we had to
- [01:14:04] continue to deliver on great search.
- [01:14:06] Great search. Great search. That was
- [01:14:08] that was key to standing out. You fast
- [01:14:10] forward to 2014 and we're working with
- [01:14:12] this tiny company who's now competing
- [01:14:14] with Gmail, who's now like sort of the
- [01:14:16] market leader people are used to using
- [01:14:18] in, you know, in their teams. And here's
- [01:14:21] this new messaging software called
- [01:14:23] Slack. and they're, you know, trying to
- [01:14:25] reach new customers and gosh, switching
- [01:14:27] to Slack is an even bigger hassle than
- [01:14:28] switching to your email address because
- [01:14:31] everybody on the team has to switch.
- [01:14:33] Well, Slack says, hey, if you believe
- [01:14:35] that having fun and boosting teamwork is
- [01:14:38] important, it's going to be clear to
- [01:14:40] you. This is a new way of looking at the
- [01:14:41] world. And when they were making their
- [01:14:44] decisions in their first big ad
- [01:14:46] campaign, their first big marketing
- [01:14:47] campaign, this was what they were trying
- [01:14:49] to convey to customers. So, we kind of
- [01:14:51] kind of see that from the inside.
- [01:14:52] Another one, we didn't see this one from
- [01:14:54] the inside, but in one that we're all
- [01:14:55] sort of familiar with is what happened
- [01:14:56] with with Chad GPT. You know, it goes
- [01:14:58] from this trusted, I don't have to think
- [01:15:00] about it. I'm going to run a Google
- [01:15:01] search to, oh wow, it's a new way of
- [01:15:03] looking at the world. There's zero
- [01:15:04] clicks, just tells you the answer. This
- [01:15:06] thing's great.
- [01:15:08] This is also something that we've seen
- [01:15:10] in some of the early success stories
- [01:15:12] from our own portfolio. So 2019, this
- [01:15:14] company called Reclaim going after
- [01:15:18] calendar management. And you know, most
- [01:15:20] of us manage our own calendars. Most of
- [01:15:22] us don't have administrators helping us
- [01:15:24] out with that and you know it's free.
- [01:15:26] We're in control. Reclaim's argument was
- [01:15:29] hey we can automatically we can use AI
- [01:15:31] to help you focus and to automatically
- [01:15:33] prioritize your calendar. And that
- [01:15:36] animated enough people to take the
- [01:15:38] plunge and switch and try it out that
- [01:15:39] they were able to build up an audience
- [01:15:41] of, you know, tens of thousands of users
- [01:15:42] and uh Dropbox acquired them last year.
- [01:15:46] A great answer to my question. You guys
- [01:15:48] well prepared for for those skeptics. Uh
- [01:15:52] part of our motivation our our selfish
- [01:15:54] mo motivation with this foundation
- [01:15:56] sprint is that you know now that we are
- [01:15:59] investing our own money into companies
- [01:16:01] and we're working with all these
- [01:16:02] founders we want them to have that same
- [01:16:05] clarity on differentiation you know we
- [01:16:07] saw how important that was to Gmail and
- [01:16:09] to Slack and to all these other
- [01:16:10] companies and we want to bring that we
- [01:16:13] want to sort of give them that same
- [01:16:14] advantage and help them avoid the you
- [01:16:18] know the pitfalls that all the other
- [01:16:19] unsuccessful teams and companies that
- [01:16:21] we've seen have fallen into. So that's
- [01:16:23] that's kind of what we're trying to do
- [01:16:24] here is bring the the lessons from these
- [01:16:26] really successful teams into, you know,
- [01:16:29] any team that reads the book and runs
- [01:16:32] this process.
- [01:16:33] And the special sauce that John and I
- [01:16:35] bring is that we're obsessed with the
- [01:16:38] the sequence of decisions that you make
- [01:16:40] and how you work together with your team
- [01:16:43] to make good decisions quickly. And that
- [01:16:47] specificity about the the method is
- [01:16:49] something that we we do have a lot of
- [01:16:51] evidence behind it working well because
- [01:16:53] of what's happened with the design
- [01:16:54] sprint and with how many successful
- [01:16:56] teams have have run that at those
- [01:16:58] companies who are you know trillion
- [01:17:01] dollar or whatever kind of giant exit
- [01:17:02] team all all kinds of teams run design
- [01:17:04] sprints. This is that same methodology
- [01:17:07] around how we work together at high
- [01:17:09] velocity and high quality and it's just
- [01:17:12] brought to a different part of the
- [01:17:13] process. Excellent answer. Uh, speaking
- [01:17:16] of the method, we went on the world's
- [01:17:18] most epic tangent. I want to bring us
- [01:17:21] back. We haven't finished actually going
- [01:17:23] through the process. I think we're
- [01:17:24] towards the tail end of it. So, let's
- [01:17:25] just finish that. What else do you do?
- [01:17:27] So, you have this this uh Yeah, I guess.
- [01:17:29] Yeah, let's catch us up. Let's catch up
- [01:17:31] with Latchet. So, as a refresher for you
- [01:17:34] who forgot, Latchet are building this
- [01:17:36] tool for artisans. They want to help
- [01:17:39] them sell with the community networking
- [01:17:41] features like you might find on Substack
- [01:17:44] and they've identified their
- [01:17:46] differentiation. They've identified
- [01:17:49] their approach now using magic lenses
- [01:17:52] and all of this is going to come
- [01:17:53] together to create a founding
- [01:17:54] hypothesis. So if we help artisans solve
- [01:17:58] online sales growth with a social sales
- [01:18:01] app and then they've also got their
- [01:18:02] backup plan or we could build the full
- [01:18:04] stack solution. If that doesn't work, we
- [01:18:07] believe they're going to choose it over
- [01:18:08] Shopify and Etsy because our solution is
- [01:18:11] cooperative and easy to use. And in this
- [01:18:14] single sentence, we've laid bare their
- [01:18:16] strategy. And now they're going to try
- [01:18:19] to find out was that work.
- [01:18:21] So
- [01:18:21] that is so cool. So the output of the
- [01:18:23] sprint is the founding hypothesis. And I
- [01:18:26] love that the term hypothesis is a part
- [01:18:28] of this because it's not telling you
- [01:18:30] this will work. It's this is the thing
- [01:18:32] you will now test. Absolutely. And every
- [01:18:36] project has at its core, every new
- [01:18:39] product has at its core a hypothesis.
- [01:18:41] They h there is a founding hypothesis.
- [01:18:44] It's just usually not explicit. It's
- [01:18:46] usually hidden. And different people on
- [01:18:48] the team may have different ideas about
- [01:18:49] what it is. And because it's not
- [01:18:51] explicit, it's very hard to interrogate
- [01:18:53] it and test it and find out if the the
- [01:18:56] different variables in it are the right
- [01:18:58] variables.
- [01:18:59] I'm curious what's in that photo to the
- [01:19:01] right as you're showing the YouTube. Oh
- [01:19:02] yeah, if uh if you're on YouTube, so
- [01:19:05] that this is just we did this sprint
- [01:19:06] together in person and so on latchet's
- [01:19:09] board you're and you're going to see
- [01:19:10] that like here's where they wrote it out
- [01:19:12] and took a photo of it and dropped it in
- [01:19:14] and then later filled it out on the
- [01:19:16] mural board.
- [01:19:18] Beautiful. And I it has their old name
- [01:19:19] there.
- [01:19:20] That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
- [01:19:21] Rebrand that
- [01:19:22] lyric, which it turns out is not the
- [01:19:24] easiest for SEO. There's a lot of lyrics
- [01:19:26] out there.
- [01:19:27] There is a lot of lyrics. I know some
- [01:19:28] lyrics. Uh and just to understand is the
- [01:19:31] next step the design sprint and that's
- [01:19:33] where you actually start testing.
- [01:19:34] Exactly. So if we zoom out now we see
- [01:19:36] now they're going to head into a
- [01:19:38] sequence of design sprints running one
- [01:19:39] after another. Each of those design
- [01:19:41] sprints starts with the founding
- [01:19:42] hypothesis. Then the team is going to
- [01:19:45] say okay what are the biggest risks that
- [01:19:47] you know that hypothesis not being true?
- [01:19:49] What do we need to assess right now?
- [01:19:51] gonna make a map of how customers
- [01:19:54] discover the product, what that core
- [01:19:55] experience looks like, and then figure
- [01:19:57] out using that map where's the where's
- [01:19:59] the key moment for assessing that risk.
- [01:20:02] So for them, the biggest risk is do
- [01:20:03] people even will these artisans even
- [01:20:05] want this thing? Are they actually going
- [01:20:06] to want to have a community sharing sort
- [01:20:09] of sales platform and they decide the
- [01:20:12] key moment for us to test that it's
- [01:20:14] actually on the landing page. They
- [01:20:15] figure we can prototype landing pages
- [01:20:17] that describe the product and learn a
- [01:20:20] lot for our first experiment just just
- [01:20:22] with landing pages. They're going to
- [01:20:24] sketch solutions. This will be familiar
- [01:20:26] to anyone who's, you know, heard about
- [01:20:27] design sprints. You're going to each
- [01:20:29] person sketching their own proposal for
- [01:20:31] how that key moment should work. Choose
- [01:20:34] the strongest of those. In this case,
- [01:20:36] they choose they're going to actually
- [01:20:37] prototype three things. So, they test
- [01:20:39] three things head-to-head against each
- [01:20:41] other. Fake brands for each one. So they
- [01:20:44] look like three different products. And
- [01:20:46] then this is a really key part. At the
- [01:20:48] end of the design sprint, we've got a
- [01:20:50] scorecard. And this is actually a new
- [01:20:51] innovation. This is not in the sprint.
- [01:20:53] Oh here we go. New hot off the
- [01:20:55] presses design sprint uh improvement.
- [01:20:59] So this scorecard is going to break down
- [01:21:01] the founding hypothesis. Hey, as we talk
- [01:21:03] to each customer, was this the right
- [01:21:05] person? Is this the right kind of
- [01:21:06] customer for us? Do they have the
- [01:21:08] problem that we think they have? Was
- [01:21:10] this the right approach for them? Did
- [01:21:13] they choose it over the competition?
- [01:21:14] They're going to test these prototypes
- [01:21:15] headto-head and also show people like,
- [01:21:17] okay, here's Etsy, here's Shopify. Now,
- [01:21:19] out of all these five options, think
- [01:21:22] about out loud about, you know, what do
- [01:21:24] you what how do you compare these? So,
- [01:21:26] do do we believe they they'd actually
- [01:21:28] choose it? Did the differentiation
- [01:21:30] actually work for those differentiators
- [01:21:32] valuable and and motivating to them?
- [01:21:34] Does it click? So, our new book is
- [01:21:37] called Click. And you know the the idea
- [01:21:40] there is you can see when a product
- [01:21:42] clicks with one person and that's a
- [01:21:44] that's a helpful signal. Now granted
- [01:21:47] these interviews are kind of a
- [01:21:48] simulation. It's not like the real world
- [01:21:50] but they're a helpful signal that we're
- [01:21:53] on track for product market fit. If we
- [01:21:55] see gosh this product just seems to be
- [01:21:56] clicking with customer after customer.
- [01:21:59] That's a really strong signal and that's
- [01:22:00] when people start to get the confidence
- [01:22:01] that it's time to build. That's a really
- [01:22:03] good term by the way. I that's such a
- [01:22:05] good way to describe what it feels like.
- [01:22:07] Does it just click with them?
- [01:22:08] Just kind of clicks. Yeah. And if you
- [01:22:10] look across Latchett's first scorecard,
- [01:22:13] there's a ton of red. It's it's a lot of
- [01:22:15] things that didn't work.
- [01:22:18] The the conclusion at the end in this
- [01:22:20] last column, there's a conclusion. Hey,
- [01:22:21] we interviewed this case. They
- [01:22:22] interviewed four customers.
- [01:22:25] Well, it looks like this is the right
- [01:22:26] customer. It looks like they have this
- [01:22:27] problem, but everything else kind of
- [01:22:30] didn't work about the hypothesis.
- [01:22:31] Approach wasn't working. Differentiation
- [01:22:33] wasn't working.
- [01:22:35] There's some many hypotheses kind of
- [01:22:36] about the prototype itself. Just lots of
- [01:22:38] red on here. So, they sprint again. And
- [01:22:42] and just zooming out for a second, this
- [01:22:43] is a team who just started working on
- [01:22:45] this new company. And you know,
- [01:22:48] sometimes it can feel slow. We talked
- [01:22:50] about it feeling slow to go through all
- [01:22:52] these steps, but they're only a week in
- [01:22:55] and they've already built three
- [01:22:56] prototypes and they've tested those
- [01:22:59] three prototypes with four real
- [01:23:00] customers. and they have this
- [01:23:02] superdetailed scorecard of here's what's
- [01:23:04] working, here's not what's not working.
- [01:23:06] That's after a week. So, it's
- [01:23:08] interesting how what can feel slow in
- [01:23:10] the hour to hour actually can really
- [01:23:13] speed you up in the the weeks and months
- [01:23:15] uh time scale.
- [01:23:17] That was such good context because I was
- [01:23:18] feeling that. And to your point, most
- [01:23:20] founders do not do this much testing,
- [01:23:23] iterating, learning in the first few
- [01:23:25] weeks of their startup. They might spend
- [01:23:27] a few weeks just talking to customers
- [01:23:29] without showing a prototype and then
- [01:23:30] they might spend a few months building
- [01:23:32] an MVP and then they might if you know
- [01:23:35] maybe they're going to spend some more
- [01:23:36] time talking to customers while showing
- [01:23:38] them the MVP maybe they'll do manual
- [01:23:39] onboarding something like that but yeah
- [01:23:41] that plays out over months and it fits
- [01:23:43] with what founders tell us you know it's
- [01:23:45] of course it's a subjective measure but
- [01:23:48] founders who go through this process
- [01:23:49] with us they say that they're able to
- [01:23:51] accelerate three to four months of work
- [01:23:53] into the three or four weeks of
- [01:23:55] backto-back sprint that we're doing
- [01:23:56] together in Character Labs.
- [01:23:59] Excellent context. Thanks for throwing
- [01:24:00] that in there.
- [01:24:01] And these conversations with customers
- [01:24:03] are so much more fruitful and pointed
- [01:24:06] when you've got the context of I know
- [01:24:08] exactly what my hypothesis is and you
- [01:24:10] have prototypes to show them. We have a
- [01:24:12] founder in our group of startups in
- [01:24:15] Character Labs at the moment. I'm
- [01:24:16] thinking of Maruthie John who's uh comes
- [01:24:19] from doing sales at Rippling and we had
- [01:24:22] been talking to tons of customers while
- [01:24:24] starting off the his company and he said
- [01:24:27] you know had 50 conversations over the
- [01:24:30] past month but I learned so much more
- [01:24:33] from even the first conversation when I
- [01:24:35] had a hypothesis and I had a prototype
- [01:24:37] or a couple prototypes to show them it's
- [01:24:40] like night and day. That is a great
- [01:24:43] example. This this all makes sense as
- [01:24:44] you guys describe it like you're you're
- [01:24:47] actually testing something very concrete
- [01:24:49] that your entire team is aligned behind
- [01:24:52] and actual prototypes and you've thought
- [01:24:55] about different directions. So it's
- [01:24:56] you're testing something very specific
- [01:24:58] versus just generally testing at your
- [01:25:01] general concept. As we go into the
- [01:25:04] second design sprint for uh Latchet,
- [01:25:08] they're making some edits to their
- [01:25:10] founding hypothesis. Now they're, you
- [01:25:13] know, revising a few things, making new
- [01:25:16] sketches, new proposals for what this
- [01:25:18] solution might look like. They've
- [01:25:20] learned a lot in that first sprint, a
- [01:25:23] new prototype, uh, that got a prototype
- [01:25:25] that has more detail now. So, they are
- [01:25:28] engineers. They're starting to actually
- [01:25:29] write some code and and put some more
- [01:25:31] detail behind the product. It's more
- [01:25:32] robust. And again, they're trying to fix
- [01:25:34] that positioning. Here's their
- [01:25:36] scorecard. And if you're watching on
- [01:25:39] YouTube, you'll be able to see it. But
- [01:25:41] again, there's a lot of red here. At
- [01:25:43] first blush, this the scorecard is is
- [01:25:45] bleeding, but there are some promising
- [01:25:47] signs. There's like maybe a few little
- [01:25:48] sun breaks. There's some spots where
- [01:25:50] some of the red has started to flip to
- [01:25:52] yellow. And so, if we look at the
- [01:25:54] conclusion on the far right, they're
- [01:25:57] starting to believe their
- [01:25:58] differentiation is dialed in and they're
- [01:26:00] starting to believe that this could be
- [01:26:02] the right approach. They may be able to
- [01:26:04] get people to choose it to the
- [01:26:05] competition even though they haven't
- [01:26:06] done it yet. So, those are starting to
- [01:26:08] become yellow lights on the scorecard.
- [01:26:12] And now they'll take what they've
- [01:26:13] learned and now we're into the third
- [01:26:16] consecutive week of design sprints.
- [01:26:18] Again, they're going to sort of review
- [01:26:20] that founding hypothesis. They're going
- [01:26:21] to sketch. They're recruiting a new
- [01:26:23] slate of customers as they do each week.
- [01:26:26] A new prototype. Again,
- [01:26:29] more code in the prototype. It's it's
- [01:26:31] becoming more and more robust, more
- [01:26:32] realistic as they're also adjusting the
- [01:26:35] the marketing and the positioning at the
- [01:26:36] same time. So, all of these things kind
- [01:26:38] of go in concert. The product itself and
- [01:26:40] the marketing are are sort of one as
- [01:26:42] they're as they're moving along. And
- [01:26:44] this is an extreme example.
- [01:26:46] What?
- [01:26:48] Everything is green.
- [01:26:49] Everything's green. If you can't see,
- [01:26:50] every single one is green.
- [01:26:51] Oh my god.
- [01:26:52] And this is this is extreme, but it is a
- [01:26:55] pattern that we've seen
- [01:26:56] again and again. This is a real example.
- [01:26:58] Wow. How do I invest? get us in this
- [01:27:00] round. This is great.
- [01:27:02] Yeah, this is pretty great.
- [01:27:03] This is great.
- [01:27:04] So, um, so we see this again and again
- [01:27:06] and I, you know, I can share a couple
- [01:27:08] of, uh, other boards of ones that are in
- [01:27:11] progress. We're also constantly
- [01:27:12] adjusting the templates so you can get
- [01:27:13] to see a little bit more how the how
- [01:27:15] people will edit their their founding
- [01:27:17] hypothesis from sprint to sprint. So,
- [01:27:19] you know, Melo, who we were talking
- [01:27:21] about, here's their first prototype and,
- [01:27:24] you know, here's their first scorecard.
- [01:27:26] Lots of lots of yellow for them. Maybe
- [01:27:28] they're a little bit more likely to use
- [01:27:30] yellow than red. And then here's the
- [01:27:33] edits to their founding hypothesis after
- [01:27:35] the first sprint. You know, so you can
- [01:27:36] kind of see in red they're changing
- [01:27:38] slightly changing the definition of
- [01:27:40] their target customer from the first
- [01:27:41] week. Slightly changing the the problem
- [01:27:44] that they're solving, slightly changing
- [01:27:46] the approach, slightly changing the
- [01:27:48] competition. They've dialed in. They've
- [01:27:50] gotten more crisp on who are we up
- [01:27:51] against. They've gotten a little bit
- [01:27:53] more crisp. just a tiny tweak on what
- [01:27:56] how do we explain this to people to get
- [01:27:58] them excited about it? What's the
- [01:27:59] differentiation? They sprint again, they
- [01:28:02] prototype again, and if we just jump
- [01:28:03] down just looking at hypotheses, they
- [01:28:05] learn a bunch and now there's another
- [01:28:07] slight tweak to that founding
- [01:28:08] hypothesis. And so week after week,
- [01:28:12] you're learning, but you're also really
- [01:28:14] able to able to track exactly what is it
- [01:28:16] that we learned and how does that affect
- [01:28:18] our our strategy. Okay, guys, this was
- [01:28:22] incredible. I think we've we've covered
- [01:28:24] the entire process. I love that you also
- [01:28:26] covered the design sprint pieces which
- [01:28:28] uh which isn't part of this book but is
- [01:28:30] such a core if you clearly these things
- [01:28:32] are very uh connected and meant to work
- [01:28:34] together. So you go from here's the
- [01:28:36] thing we should be building to how to
- [01:28:37] actually test it. Let me ask you before
- [01:28:40] we wrap up is there anything else that
- [01:28:42] you think is really important for people
- [01:28:44] to know before they start trying this
- [01:28:46] process at home and is there anything
- [01:28:49] you can point them to to actually try
- [01:28:50] this at home? One thing we didn't talk
- [01:28:52] about we go we used an example of a
- [01:28:54] company who's not building an AI first
- [01:28:58] product. Latchet's building a you know
- [01:29:00] this thisworked community
- [01:29:03] uh sales platform for for artisans. It
- [01:29:06] would probably be interesting to look at
- [01:29:07] how people use this when they are
- [01:29:10] building a very technical product when
- [01:29:12] they're vibe coding prototypes. That's a
- [01:29:14] question we're getting all the time.
- [01:29:15] What's the influence on this of the
- [01:29:17] speed with which you can build
- [01:29:18] something?
- [01:29:19] That's an awesome idea. Let's definitely
- [01:29:20] do that.
- [01:29:20] Yeah. Okay. So let's jump in here and
- [01:29:22] take a look at a company again in our
- [01:29:24] current group of labs teams. Axion
- [01:29:27] Orbital it's called and the founder Denj
- [01:29:30] is actually running this whole process
- [01:29:32] solo which is pretty cool too. He's a
- [01:29:34] he's a remarkable guy and we have a
- [01:29:35] couple of solo founders right now and uh
- [01:29:37] who are you know able to generate you
- [01:29:40] can see just to give like a sneak peek
- [01:29:42] he's generating when we talk about
- [01:29:43] customers all these sticky notes himself
- [01:29:45] and making the decisions himself about
- [01:29:47] which is the right one. But to ground us
- [01:29:49] in this story, his founding hypothesis
- [01:29:51] is he wants to help geospatial devs
- [01:29:54] solve these sort of complex workflows
- [01:29:56] with a browser-based noode development
- [01:29:59] environment. So we'll um we'll take a
- [01:30:01] look just really quickly at what his
- [01:30:04] prototypes look like. And in the first
- [01:30:07] week, I can show you this prototype
- [01:30:09] right here. And it's a marketing page.
- [01:30:13] And on this marketing page, there's a
- [01:30:16] link to a uh to a video. So, if I click
- [01:30:20] find out more, I'm going to see this
- [01:30:22] video. And this video is going to kind
- [01:30:25] of hear Den and Jay talking over it. And
- [01:30:29] it's going to kind of walk through a
- [01:30:31] screen share of a very rudimentary
- [01:30:33] version of what this product might look
- [01:30:35] like. Now, if you're watching on YouTube
- [01:30:38] and you see this prototype, you might
- [01:30:40] think, "Boy, that marketing page and the
- [01:30:42] demo itself, pretty bare bones, not the
- [01:30:45] most polished looking. This is uh this
- [01:30:48] doesn't look super compelling." So, he
- [01:30:50] was focusing in that first sprint on the
- [01:30:52] messaging, you know, on finding those
- [01:30:54] those people who actually have that
- [01:30:56] role, testing it with them, and he
- [01:30:58] learned a lot. So, if we, you know, sort
- [01:30:59] of go back to his his scorecard, we'll
- [01:31:02] see, okay, that was, you know, that was
- [01:31:04] a pretty good one. actually a lot of
- [01:31:05] green on his first scorecard, but he
- [01:31:07] also felt like what he tested was was
- [01:31:08] pretty incomplete. Now, one thing that's
- [01:31:11] cool here, we saw the big leap with
- [01:31:12] Latchet from one week to another in
- [01:31:14] terms of like their learnings and the
- [01:31:15] scorecards. One of the things that's
- [01:31:17] interesting here is to go from Vinn and
- [01:31:19] Jay's first prototype here to his second
- [01:31:21] prototype and it's obvious he's been
- [01:31:24] able to just build a ton in uh in the
- [01:31:27] next week and he's using, you know, AI
- [01:31:29] based tools. He's doing a lot of work.
- [01:31:30] He's also just a terrific engineer. But
- [01:31:33] here we've got like a much more real
- [01:31:35] looking marketing page, very detailed.
- [01:31:37] And an important thing that he's done
- [01:31:39] here with this is he's built out a lot
- [01:31:42] and created a video of something so that
- [01:31:44] the product while not fully functional,
- [01:31:47] you can see exactly how it works. So if
- [01:31:49] we sort of play this video, he's created
- [01:31:52] this demonstration of what it looks like
- [01:31:54] when you type in a query into the engine
- [01:31:57] and exactly the kinds of results you
- [01:31:59] get. And by doing a combination of vibe
- [01:32:02] coding, real coding, all of which is
- [01:32:05] based off of, you know, pencil sketches,
- [01:32:07] we can go back and see the sketches he's
- [01:32:09] doing on paper to define this is what I
- [01:32:10] think needs to be in there to make this
- [01:32:12] compelling to deliver on my
- [01:32:13] differentiation. And then he's using a a
- [01:32:15] product video so that the entire thing
- [01:32:17] doesn't have to work fully free form.
- [01:32:20] That's what it can look like when a team
- [01:32:23] is building something that's that's you
- [01:32:25] know more AI ccentric when it's a more
- [01:32:27] sophisticated tool when people are going
- [01:32:29] to be curious about the sort of the ins
- [01:32:31] and outs of it. So along those lines,
- [01:32:33] where do you find people are leveraging
- [01:32:36] AI most in helping them through these
- [01:32:38] sprints through either the foundation
- [01:32:41] sprint or the design sprint? Is it
- [01:32:42] mostly just by coding prototypes?
- [01:32:45] That's definitely the first and biggest
- [01:32:48] use of AI in sprint so far is is in, you
- [01:32:52] know, making prototypes that look more
- [01:32:54] realistic faster. And you know, it's
- [01:32:57] kind of like uh you know, having an
- [01:32:59] entire prototyping team on standby,
- [01:33:01] right? so that you don't have to just
- [01:33:03] make it yourself and sort of piece
- [01:33:04] things together, but you can have, you
- [01:33:06] know, a ton of people ready to jump in,
- [01:33:08] make something look really realistic.
- [01:33:11] But it's also really critical. We found
- [01:33:14] that while you're outsourcing that
- [01:33:16] prototyping work, you don't outsource
- [01:33:18] the thinking like you don't kind of skip
- [01:33:20] over the the part where you think about,
- [01:33:23] well, what is the actual copy on the
- [01:33:26] website? How do I actually describe what
- [01:33:27] the product is, how it's differentiated?
- [01:33:30] Um, and so it's it's one of the reasons
- [01:33:33] why doing the foundation sprint first
- [01:33:35] and then doing a design sprint can
- [01:33:37] really help you and and you know because
- [01:33:40] it it allows you to spend time working
- [01:33:43] on that harder part of what it means to
- [01:33:46] design and and build a product. And then
- [01:33:48] once you have a clear view of that then
- [01:33:50] you can use AI tools to go really fast.
- [01:33:53] And you know, in this example that Jake
- [01:33:55] is showing of Axian orbital, people get
- [01:33:57] really clever about which parts of this
- [01:33:58] need to be real, which parts of this can
- [01:34:00] be vibe coded, which parts of this can
- [01:34:01] just be a static Figma mockup. Um, and
- [01:34:04] it's all about kind of creating a
- [01:34:06] simulation, uh, something that looks
- [01:34:08] realistic that you can put in front of
- [01:34:10] real customers to help you answer the
- [01:34:12] the key questions. That's a really good
- [01:34:15] point that you're making. And again,
- [01:34:16] it's just a reminder, you will move
- [01:34:18] faster if you slow down a little bit at
- [01:34:19] the beginning that because prototyping
- [01:34:21] is so easy now and just things that
- [01:34:23] look, it's so easy to make something
- [01:34:24] that looks really nice and kind of doing
- [01:34:26] what you want. But spending a little
- [01:34:28] time making sure you understand what
- [01:34:29] you're testing and what you want uh is
- [01:34:32] becomes more important.
- [01:34:33] We had a couple of teams in this current
- [01:34:34] group of character labs where they
- [01:34:36] jumped to vibe coding prototypes like
- [01:34:38] right away, like at the very beginning.
- [01:34:41] And you know when you when you generate
- [01:34:44] something using an using an LLM using an
- [01:34:46] AI tool like it looks pretty real like
- [01:34:48] it looks you know it looks believable
- [01:34:50] and so I think there's a temptation to
- [01:34:51] say like okay like this is this is good
- [01:34:54] to go like it it looks close enough that
- [01:34:55] I'm just going to you know show that to
- [01:34:57] customers and then what they found was
- [01:35:00] like actually the you know it was so it
- [01:35:03] was super generic like it didn't really
- [01:35:04] describe what the product was. didn't
- [01:35:06] really describe how it was different
- [01:35:07] because you know it was it was generated
- [01:35:10] by a model that uh is trained on you
- [01:35:13] know sort of existing products and so in
- [01:35:15] that second sprint that was when they
- [01:35:17] really took a step back and said okay
- [01:35:19] let's think through this and then shift
- [01:35:21] into prototyping mode so it's definitely
- [01:35:24] helping people speed up but we also
- [01:35:25] think there's an important lesson here
- [01:35:26] that while you're outsourcing prototype
- [01:35:29] prototyping don't outsource the thinking
- [01:35:31] as well
- [01:35:32] I see you pulling something up Jake that
- [01:35:34] might be
- [01:35:35] imagine you want to show?
- [01:35:37] Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting
- [01:35:38] to see the sketches that went into
- [01:35:40] Denjay's prototype, the Axian orbital
- [01:35:42] prototype that we just looked at,
- [01:35:43] because they they are super detailed.
- [01:35:44] And this is doing this level of thought
- [01:35:47] where you're you're pausing, you're
- [01:35:50] being really intentional about what does
- [01:35:52] the customer need to know, what needs to
- [01:35:54] happen for them to find a solution to
- [01:35:56] their problem on, you know, in within
- [01:35:59] the product.
- [01:36:01] That's a way of doing your prompt
- [01:36:03] engineering. If you end up vibe coding
- [01:36:05] this prototype, but you start off with a
- [01:36:07] very clear plan about this is what the
- [01:36:09] thing needs to look at look like rather
- [01:36:12] than going immediately into a
- [01:36:14] conversational mode where you're sort of
- [01:36:15] co-designing with the LLM and going back
- [01:36:18] and forth via chat conversation. This is
- [01:36:21] much likelier to yield an opinionated
- [01:36:24] product that makes sense, that's very
- [01:36:27] clearly defined around the the problem
- [01:36:29] that you're trying to solve, the tasks
- [01:36:30] that need to happen to solve that
- [01:36:32] problem, and the right messaging, the
- [01:36:34] right wording that's really crisply
- [01:36:35] aligned with what you know about your
- [01:36:37] customers, what you know about what they
- [01:36:39] care about. That's such a good point.
- [01:36:41] Again, just the concept of the primal
- [01:36:43] mark is ringing in my head as you talk
- [01:36:45] about this. Just as soon as you make
- [01:36:47] that prototype, everything from that
- [01:36:48] point is a response to that first idea
- [01:36:51] versus have I actually thought through
- [01:36:52] what this should be. Guys, we did it.
- [01:36:54] This is uh incredible. I think this is
- [01:36:57] going to help a lot of people think
- [01:36:58] through and actually save a lot of time.
- [01:37:00] Um is there anything else that you want
- [01:37:03] to share, leave listeners with? Maybe a
- [01:37:05] last nugget or something you want to I
- [01:37:07] don't know, just double down on to leave
- [01:37:09] folks with before we wrap up. Well, one
- [01:37:11] quick thing is that we've we've shared a
- [01:37:14] lot of examples in this uh in this
- [01:37:16] conversation and we actually have a
- [01:37:18] template, a Miro template that folks can
- [01:37:22] use if they want to run their own
- [01:37:23] foundation sprint. It's the template
- [01:37:25] that we use, you know, when we're
- [01:37:26] working with founders, taking them
- [01:37:28] through these sprints. We we do our work
- [01:37:29] in Miro. Even if we're in person with
- [01:37:31] them, we're usually working in Mirro or
- [01:37:33] maybe working on paper and then
- [01:37:34] capturing it in Muro because it's it's
- [01:37:36] just such a great canvas to work on. Um,
- [01:37:39] and and we'll make that template
- [01:37:40] available so anybody who's who's
- [01:37:42] listening or watching can can grab that
- [01:37:44] and and use it to run their own
- [01:37:46] foundation sprint.
- [01:37:47] That's amazing. You answered the
- [01:37:49] question I asked that I forgot to come
- [01:37:50] back to. Uh, can we give people a URL?
- [01:37:53] We'll put it in the show notes, but
- [01:37:54] should they is it at your Yeah, I guess
- [01:37:56] where can folks find it?
- [01:37:57] You should find it at character.vc and
- [01:37:59] you can uh go there and we'll have we'll
- [01:38:02] have a page for you to
- [01:38:04] Amazing. So easy.
- [01:38:05] Uh, that is awesome. So, that's so
- [01:38:06] awesome that you guys are doing that.
- [01:38:08] Obviously, you could also read the book
- [01:38:09] and that goes through a lot of this
- [01:38:10] process, but I think the template is
- [01:38:12] just like a plug-and-play. Let's just do
- [01:38:14] this at home. Obviously, if they want to
- [01:38:15] go deeper, they can work with you guys
- [01:38:17] to have you. It's such a win. They take
- [01:38:19] money. You give them money and you help
- [01:38:22] them figure out what the heck to build.
- [01:38:25] What a deal. And that's also
- [01:38:26] character.bc. They want to explore that.
- [01:38:28] Y
- [01:38:29] amazing. Okay. Uh, is there anything
- [01:38:31] else, Jake, that you wanted to share
- [01:38:32] before we close up?
- [01:38:34] No, just, you know, if if you made it
- [01:38:37] this far, uh hopefully your your mind
- [01:38:39] and heart is is open to this idea, but
- [01:38:42] we know it's a lot to ask to clear the
- [01:38:44] calendar and follow these these steps.
- [01:38:46] But if John and I weren't so convinced
- [01:38:50] that beginnings are essential to getting
- [01:38:54] your best efforts in the hands of people
- [01:38:56] and to achieving the the things you want
- [01:38:58] for your customers,
- [01:39:00] we wouldn't be doing this. We wouldn't
- [01:39:02] be going to all the trouble. There are
- [01:39:03] simpler things we can we can be going
- [01:39:05] after. Um the the kind of cool thing
- [01:39:09] we've found about working in this way
- [01:39:11] though we've we've focused a lot on
- [01:39:13] finding product market fit and building
- [01:39:15] your business, getting started, getting
- [01:39:16] momentum, getting alignment, all these
- [01:39:18] things that tactically are important
- [01:39:20] that business-wise are important. But
- [01:39:22] another part of it that's a nice side
- [01:39:26] benefit that actually maybe is the most
- [01:39:27] important thing of all is how close it
- [01:39:31] brings you to your customers, to the
- [01:39:33] people who you're building for because
- [01:39:34] you're interacting with them. You're
- [01:39:36] focusing on them as you plan and you're
- [01:39:37] interacting with them on a weekly basis
- [01:39:39] when you work in this way and how close
- [01:39:42] it brings teammates together in a very
- [01:39:45] authentic way. We're working together on
- [01:39:47] the most important things and we don't
- [01:39:49] have to navigate the usual social
- [01:39:51] dynamics of conversations where one
- [01:39:53] person has an idea and they're pitching
- [01:39:55] it. We don't have to navigate the
- [01:39:57] constant context switches of the
- [01:39:59] calendar that dominates our days. We're
- [01:40:01] just working on the most important thing
- [01:40:03] and the structure takes care of a lot of
- [01:40:05] the the difficulty of the
- [01:40:09] the process of what we should do. And we
- [01:40:12] just find people come out of it with
- [01:40:14] renewed motivation, renewed energy, and
- [01:40:17] renewed enthusiasm around the fact that
- [01:40:19] they get to work on what actually
- [01:40:20] matters to them.
- [01:40:21] Yeah. And it just feels like really fun.
- [01:40:22] Just this part of the process is so fun.
- [01:40:24] And then not having to decide how to
- [01:40:26] approach it. Having someone just give
- [01:40:27] you here's a framework to follow.
- [01:40:29] It's like a yoga class, right? It's like
- [01:40:30] I don't know how to do yoga, but explain
- [01:40:32] to me step by step.
- [01:40:35] Yoga for startups. That'll be the title
- [01:40:37] for this episode.
- [01:40:39] Guys, this was awesome. Uh, I'm gonna
- [01:40:41] skip the lightning round just because
- [01:40:43] we've gone long. And I guess just where
- [01:40:44] can folks find you online and how can
- [01:40:46] listeners be useful to you?
