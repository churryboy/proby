## Key insight / summary

- **창업자는 첫 번째 세일즈맨이어야 함**: 제품과 고객에 대한 깊이 있는 이해, 차별적 비전, 그리고 고객이 구매하지 않는 이유를 파악할 수 있는 것은 오직 창업자뿐
- **B2B 세일즈는 90% 이상이 실패하는 숫자 게임**: "Some will, some won't, so what, next" 마인드셋으로 실패 회피가 아닌 실패 회복에 집중해야 함
- **세일즈는 거래 성사가 아니라 문제 해결**: 고객의 목표 달성, 문제 해결, 니즈 충족을 도우면 거래는 자연스럽게 따라오는 결과물
- **전문 세일즈맨 조기 채용은 스타트업 실패의 지름길**: 창업자가 직접 세일즈를 통해 제품-시장 피드백을 얻기 전에는 절대 금물
- **B2B는 복잡한 문제 해결**: 단순하면 이미 해결되었을 것이고, 혁신적 방법으로 더 나은/빠른/저렴한 해결책 제시가 핵심
- **기업 세일즈는 항상 무언가를 대체함**: 현재 내부/외부의 누구 또는 무엇을 대체하는지 파악하고 관리하는 것이 중요
- **의사결정 구조의 복잡성**: 평가자, 결정자, 구매자가 다른 경우가 대부분이며 숨겨진 agenda와 이해관계를 파악해야 함
- **고객 프로파일의 중요성**: 매일 아침 "오늘 가장 생산적인 시간 사용은?"에 답하기 위한 명확한 타겟 기준 필요

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **창업자 주도 초기 세일즈 전략 수립**: 전문 세일즈 인력 채용보다는 창업자가 직접 타겟 고객(유니콘 리서처, 엔터프라이즈 리서처)과 소통하여 AI 모더레이션에 대한 실제 pain point와 adoption barrier 파악 → 최소 30명 이상 심층 인터뷰 진행
- **명확한 대체 가치 정의**: "Proby가 무엇을 대체하는가" 명시 - 기존 외부 리서치 에이전시인지, 내부 수동 모더레이션 프로세스인지, 아니면 리서치 자체를 포기하는 상황인지 구체적으로 정의하고 각각에 대한 차별화 전략 수립
- **복잡한 B2B 구매 프로세스 대응**: 리서치 팀 내에서도 실무진(pain point 경험자), 팀장(예산 결정권자), 경영진(ROI 평가자)이 다를 수 있음 → 각 stakeholder별 맞춤형 가치 제안과 커뮤니케이션 전략 개발
- **실패 친화적 세일즈 프로세스 설계**: 90% 실패율을 전제로 한 효율적인 고객 disqualification 시스템 구축 → qualified prospect를 찾기보다는 unqualified를 빠르게 걸러내는 프레임워크 개발
- **숫자 게임을 위한 체계적 접근**: McKinsey 분석에서 제시한 명확한 고객 프로파일(유니콘 → 엔터프라이즈 → 스타트업 순서) 기반으로 daily sales activity 집중 → 각 단계별 목표 접촉 수, 전환율 KPI 설정
- **문제 해결 중심 포지셔닝 강화**: "AI 아바타 모더레이터"보다는 "국제 리서치의 비용/시간 문제 해결사"로 포지셔닝 → 고객이 Proby 구매가 아닌 본인들의 리서치 목표 달성에 집중하도록 유도
- **조기 전문가 채용 경고 반영**: 현재 McKinsey 분석에서 언급된 GTM 전략 부재 상황에서 세일즈 전문가 채용은 위험 → 창업자가 직접 최소 10-15개 파일럿 고객과 작업한 후 재검토
- **세일즈 툴킷 구축**: Kent가 언급한 customer profile과 sales pipeline을 Proby 상황에 맞게 구체화 → "금융 서비스 중 패밀리 오피스, 100M 이상, 보스턴 25마일" 수준의 구체적 타겟 정의 필요

- [01:20] to be with you today um we're gonna
- [01:23] cover
- [01:24] a very small select set
- [01:27] of material from my full lecture series

- [01:40] performance and your
- [01:41] efficiency um i'm i i don't have a lot
- [01:44] of patience for theory
- [01:46] um i'm really all about tactics and
- [01:48] trade craft and
- [01:50] skills and knowledge so my goal here uh
- [01:54] today
- [01:54] and over thursday is that um you walk
- [01:58] away with a better understanding
- [02:00] and maybe a a better mindset
- [02:03] and a few skills that you can apply
- [02:06] uh to your startup or your scale up to
- [02:09] help improve
- [02:10] uh your sales so with that
- [02:14] um i'll start by sharing some good news
- [02:17] um is my experience as a founder
- [02:20] there's only two things you need to
- [02:21] worry about uh and that's revenue
- [02:25] and everything else and uh i figured
- [02:28] that out
- [02:29] early after i started running out of uh
- [02:31] runway
- [02:32] and spending more time are you
- [02:36] are you sharing your screen can't see
- [02:37] your screen yes i am
- [02:39] can you can you see me i can see you but
- [02:42] not your screen
- [02:43] um hang on a second here yeah that
- [02:47] good news i was sharing with you it's
- [02:50] revenue and everything else
- [02:53] it turns out if you're unable to get
- [02:55] revenue flowing
- [02:58] everything else doesn't matter however
- [03:01] once you get
- [03:02] cash in the door um then all the other
- [03:05] things
- [03:06] the myriad things that you do as a
- [03:07] founder all of a sudden seem manageable
- [03:11] so if you're unable to figure out
- [03:14] at some point in your startup journey
- [03:16] how to acquire
- [03:18] customers cost-effectively game over
- [03:22] so that's really what i want to help you
- [03:24] with
- [03:25] i focus on b2b sales
- [03:30] i assume uh presume most of you here are
- [03:33] uh in in the b2b marketplace
- [03:37] uh which is a completely different
- [03:39] animal from
- [03:40] from b to c sales uh what is
- [03:43] b2b sales uh well it's you
- [03:46] as a smaller business selling to a
- [03:48] larger business
- [03:49] and you are solving um
- [03:52] necessarily goals problems needs
- [03:56] that are complex if they weren't complex
- [03:59] they wouldn't be problems or they would
- [04:01] probably already be
- [04:03] solved and it's typically solved by you
- [04:06] thinking about
- [04:07] a different uh better faster cheaper way
- [04:11] um leveraging innovation to solve those
- [04:14] problems which involves people doing
- [04:16] something differently
- [04:19] enterprise sales involves higher priced
- [04:22] offerings and it's not necessarily
- [04:24] related
- [04:25] to your cogs what it takes you to
- [04:29] build and deliver and service your
- [04:31] product uh the higher price offerings
- [04:34] uh more based upon the scale of the
- [04:38] problem
- [04:39] that you're solving so for example if
- [04:42] you're solving a one dollar problem for
- [04:44] a million people
- [04:45] it's a million dollar problem that
- [04:46] you're solving
- [04:48] enterprise sales almost always involves
- [04:51] unknowns and
- [04:52] uncertainties and understanding from a
- [04:55] sales perspective how to manage those
- [04:58] is very very important in addition
- [05:02] um enterprise sales b2b sales almost
- [05:05] always replaces something or
- [05:09] someone inside or outside the
- [05:12] organization
- [05:13] it's critically important to understand
- [05:17] who or what or both your solution
- [05:20] displaces as part of the sales process
- [05:26] enterprise sales are also
- [05:30] involved because people are involved
- [05:33] a lot's hidden agenda in forces
- [05:37] and so part of the skills as a
- [05:40] salesperson
- [05:41] is to have the ability
- [05:44] and the understanding of asking the
- [05:46] right questions of people to surface
- [05:48] those
- [05:50] agendas and forces so that you can
- [05:53] manage them
- [05:54] head-on versus uh deal with them
- [05:57] um deal with the outcome
- [06:00] of those um it's very seldom
- [06:04] than an enterprise sale the same person
- [06:07] will
- [06:08] evaluate the offering make the decision
- [06:11] and write the check
- [06:12] it's almost always the case that
- [06:14] enterprise sales
- [06:16] involves a team purchasing decision
- [06:19] where the uh those aspects of the sale
- [06:23] are distributed amongst uh four five six
- [06:26] people in the organization
- [06:28] and because of all this b2b sales
- [06:31] is a much longer expensive sales cycle
- [06:36] sales is your most expensive
- [06:39] investment in terms of real cost and in
- [06:42] terms of
- [06:43] opportunity costs um
- [06:46] it's expensive to get right but it's
- [06:50] very expensive if you get it wrong
- [06:55] so a little bit about the mindset in
- [06:57] sales
- [06:58] um and and this is a really
- [07:02] important uh part of sales it's not just
- [07:04] tools it's
- [07:05] not just skills it's about having a
- [07:08] proper mindset
- [07:10] uh which might be a little bit different
- [07:12] than how you think about
- [07:14] the sales profession or sales people
- [07:17] um so contrary to what you uh
- [07:21] might have understood um sales is not
- [07:24] about chasing people down to close deals
- [07:27] it's about helping people achieve a goal
- [07:31] solve a problem or satisfy a need by
- [07:34] coincidentally purchasing your product
- [07:37] or service
- [07:38] and it turns out that if you're
- [07:39] successful helping people
- [07:41] transactions will naturally occur so
- [07:44] think about
- [07:44] transactions or sales is an outcome
- [07:47] measure
- [07:48] and that your your attitude and your
- [07:52] behavior
- [07:53] with people in in your competence
- [07:56] and helping people solve their problem
- [07:58] as the leading
- [07:59] indicators of that outcome measure
- [08:03] sales is also not about picking winners
- [08:06] and losers we learned a long time ago
- [08:11] and working for the past 20 years at mit
- [08:14] that
- [08:15] we're not very good at that it's about
- [08:18] helping people shape and navigate
- [08:21] and pivot and change in the successful
- [08:25] companies that leave mit
- [08:27] bear very little resemblance to what
- [08:29] they look like
- [08:31] when we first started working with them
- [08:33] so if you were to pick
- [08:34] uh winning customers or customers that
- [08:36] you think are going to close
- [08:38] um and those that you do not think
- [08:41] uh are going to close um you're probably
- [08:45] wasting
- [08:46] a lot of your time and you're missing
- [08:48] out on opportunities so
- [08:50] just like startups sales are not about
- [08:52] picking winners and losers
- [08:54] it's about feeding a process where
- [08:58] at the end of the day there's only two
- [09:00] things that you control as a founder
- [09:02] your attitude and your behavior so i'm
- [09:04] going to be these are sort of
- [09:06] overriding themes that i'm going to be
- [09:08] talking about
- [09:10] over the course of the next hour is you
- [09:13] know
- [09:13] how do you how do you modify how do you
- [09:15] control
- [09:16] um your attitude and your behaviors and
- [09:20] use them wisely
- [09:21] to improve your sales performance and it
- [09:24] turns out
- [09:25] that sales
- [09:29] people are not born with a sales gene
- [09:32] it's not something that you learn in
- [09:35] school
- [09:36] it's something that you learn through
- [09:38] practice in in repetition just like
- [09:40] anything else
- [09:41] and most technical founders can be very
- [09:43] very good at sales and of course the
- [09:45] ones that survive
- [09:46] always figure it out
- [09:50] the sales role itself is the business
- [09:53] profession closest to a full contact
- [09:55] sport
- [09:56] and like an athlete they require
- [09:59] talent coaching team play and great
- [10:03] execution skills uh the sales profession
- [10:07] is also a numbers game with a very
- [10:10] unattractive win-loss ratio
- [10:14] enterprise sales is a 90
- [10:17] percent plus failure driven activity
- [10:21] um i'd like to share with you is a
- [10:24] failure driven
- [10:26] activity everybody at mit has their own
- [10:30] formulas and algorithms and so of course
- [10:32] i had to come up with
- [10:34] one on my own here for sales i call it
- [10:37] sw cubed over n
- [10:39] you know for sales people in a failure
- [10:41] driven profession
- [10:42] this stands for some will some won't so
- [10:45] what
- [10:46] next there's your attitude
- [10:49] for selling into a failure driven
- [10:51] profession
- [10:53] let me share with you that if you only
- [10:56] fail
- [10:56] 10 in the in sales you
- [11:00] will be an extremely um
- [11:03] successful entrepreneur and you will be
- [11:06] the exception
- [11:08] the reality is in sales um
- [11:11] that the failure rate is closer to 97 or
- [11:14] 98
- [11:16] um a lot of sales books will tell you
- [11:18] and you've probably heard
- [11:19] before if you've read any of them that
- [11:21] sales is always about qualifying
- [11:23] customers always be qualifying
- [11:27] um i i disagree with that um
- [11:30] strongly i believe that qualified
- [11:32] customers are really really easy to spot
- [11:35] i think that effective sales is about
- [11:37] disqualifying people with the appearance
- [11:39] of real
- [11:41] and helping people to opt in and opt out
- [11:43] of your process by asking questions not
- [11:45] by making statements
- [11:48] so failure uh is the name of the game
- [11:50] it's not about failure avoidance
- [11:52] it's about failure recovery and
- [11:56] in the sales profession unlike a
- [11:58] professional
- [12:00] baseball coach you can you can lose 90
- [12:02] percent of your
- [12:03] your games and still keep your job
- [12:08] the founder is always the first
- [12:11] salesperson
- [12:12] why well you have intimate knowledge of
- [12:15] the offering the customer the need the
- [12:18] problem
- [12:20] uh you also uh and and of course the
- [12:23] value that you're
- [12:24] uh delivering people you also have this
- [12:27] skewed view
- [12:28] of the world right you have a different
- [12:30] way of of looking at things
- [12:33] uh this distorted uh view of reality
- [12:37] it helps you overcome this is your
- [12:39] vision here this is
- [12:41] this is why you founded your company
- [12:44] um and importantly you as a founder
- [12:49] need to understand firsthand all the
- [12:51] blocking issues that prevent customers
- [12:54] from writing you a check
- [12:55] right all this early product market
- [12:58] feedback
- [12:59] this is really essential especially as
- [13:01] you transition
- [13:02] from a sort of a vision whiteboard
- [13:06] view of things through your product
- [13:08] market fit
- [13:09] where you start to influence your
- [13:12] product roadmap
- [13:14] more so from trends and patterns that
- [13:17] you see
- [13:18] from talking with many many different
- [13:20] customers
- [13:21] and it's these feature requests and
- [13:23] rejections
- [13:25] here that that give you that afford you
- [13:27] that that precious fuel
- [13:29] for your your product roadmap now in
- [13:33] case
- [13:34] um uh some or many of you have not
- [13:38] already experienced this already
- [13:40] um one of the things that um i've uh
- [13:44] that's become clear to me uh over the
- [13:47] past 20 years working with founders
- [13:50] is that if you really want your your
- [13:52] company to fail
- [13:53] go out and hire a professional
- [13:55] salesperson
- [13:56] we see this time and time again where
- [14:00] startups fail when the founder believes
- [14:02] that bringing in a salesperson will
- [14:04] solve
- [14:05] the sales dilemma to the contrary this
- [14:09] is usually an accelerant to failure
- [14:11] and it becomes a very expensive
- [14:15] learning uh exercise for for the founder
- [14:18] and
- [14:18] very very rarely works out
- [14:22] so um in my my normal um
- [14:25] lecture material i have a whole bunch of
- [14:28] material at this point where i talk
- [14:30] about
- [14:30] the successful personality
- [14:34] and skill traits of a salesperson what
- [14:37] makes them
- [14:38] tick what makes them successful
- [14:42] again i had to really limit what what i
- [14:45] covered with you in a short time period
- [14:47] today so i thought
- [14:48] what might be more impactful is that we
- [14:50] just
- [14:51] jump straight into uh the scale uh
- [14:54] sales toolkit and mechanics
- [14:58] so with that um is a
- [15:01] failure driven profession in a numbers
- [15:04] game
- [15:04] it's really uh about prospecting
- [15:08] right and when you're playing a numbers
- [15:10] game
- [15:11] you have to have a tools you have to
- [15:13] have a game plan you have to have
- [15:14] tools and a methodology which are
- [15:18] essential for your focus in your
- [15:21] efficiency and answering the question
- [15:24] that you have
- [15:25] every morning when you wake up when
- [15:27] you're looking at
- [15:29] many more opportunities than you have
- [15:31] time to address
- [15:32] and that is what's the most productive
- [15:34] use of my time today
- [15:37] so there's two tools that
- [15:40] can help you with the first is the
- [15:42] customer profile
- [15:43] and this is the criteria very specific
- [15:46] criteria
- [15:48] that you rely on to focus
- [15:51] your daily sales activity and then
- [15:54] secondly
- [15:55] once you figure that out uh your sales
- [15:58] pipeline
- [15:59] also called your funnel and this is your
- [16:01] methodology
- [16:03] that you use to drive focus and
- [16:06] efficiency
- [16:07] this is a time management tool for you
- [16:11] so let's start with the profile um
- [16:14] the profile is what you rely on to focus
- [16:18] your sales activity
- [16:19] it consists of three components
- [16:23] at the outside ring here is your company
- [16:26] profile this is your target customer
- [16:29] and they exist within a specific
- [16:32] industry a type of company within that
- [16:35] industry
- [16:37] size and geography so for example
- [16:40] i'm targeting financial services company
- [16:43] of type
- [16:44] family offices with over 100 million
- [16:47] under management within 25 miles of
- [16:49] boston
- [16:50] it would be a very good example of a
- [16:53] well-defined
- [16:54] company profile the company profile
- [16:58] if it's well defined one of the acid
- [17:00] tests there is you should be able to get
- [17:02] companies addresses from this if you
- [17:05] have a good
- [17:06] profile you should be able to with a
- [17:08] good search
- [17:10] um come up with a long list of companies
- [17:13] uh in their specific sp street
- [17:16] address that needs that
- [17:20] inside the company profile is the buyer
- [17:22] profile
- [17:23] this is the person inside that company
- [17:27] that stands
- [17:28] to gain the most or lose the most
- [17:31] from your offering so the buyer profile
- [17:35] is determined by a job title
- [17:38] or role with resp specific
- [17:41] responsibilities
- [17:43] and unmet needs often expressed in the
- [17:46] form
- [17:47] of a of a use case so in the
- [17:50] prior example here this would be
- [17:53] a a research analyst who's responsible
- [17:56] for
- [17:57] vetting investment opportunities
- [18:00] and is using very old outdated
- [18:04] inefficient and error-prone research
- [18:06] methods
- [18:10] and then lastly uh at the center of your
- [18:13] profile
- [18:14] is the decision-making unit and this is
- [18:17] the
- [18:17] the folks inside that organization that
- [18:20] make decisions they influence the
- [18:22] decisions
- [18:23] and they have access to a checkbook and
- [18:25] it's very different in every
- [18:26] organization depending
- [18:28] upon the people their culture
- [18:31] etc and especially in in much larger
- [18:35] companies so these are the three
- [18:37] components of a
- [18:38] customer profile and it's really really
- [18:41] important
- [18:42] that as you go and figure this out this
- [18:45] is not just something that comes out of
- [18:47] your business plan
- [18:48] this is something that you learn and
- [18:50] fine-tune after talking with
- [18:53] 100 or 200 prospects and you eventually
- [18:56] get it down to where it's
- [18:57] fairly chiseled down and i recommend if
- [19:00] you go through this process
- [19:02] if you do have a co-founder or other
- [19:04] people on your team to engage
- [19:06] everybody on your team while figuring
- [19:08] this out
- [19:12] some recommendations uh in terms of
- [19:14] questions
- [19:15] that you ask people in figuring this out
- [19:19] that have helped me in the past
- [19:23] gather facts not opinions um a lot of
- [19:26] people fail
- [19:27] in their in their custer customer
- [19:29] profile development by asking people
- [19:31] if they would do something if or would
- [19:34] they
- [19:35] do something if and people love to share
- [19:38] their opinions and theory and so forth
- [19:40] but that's not helpful
- [19:42] um i recommend that you gather facts
- [19:45] uh against what you're selling into
- [19:48] don't ask people would you do something
- [19:51] but ask them
- [19:52] do you do something so facts not
- [19:55] opinions
- [19:56] and facts related to pain and cost
- [19:59] not theoretical or implied gains
- [20:03] right which is very difficult to measure
- [20:07] so figure out where the pain and the
- [20:09] cost is related to those facts
- [20:11] and facts pain and cost related to a
- [20:15] single use case
- [20:16] right now of course early on pursuing
- [20:20] multiple scenarios
- [20:22] is necessary as you're sort of figuring
- [20:24] out your product
- [20:25] market fit but many founders if you ask
- [20:28] them
- [20:29] well who your customer is they may give
- [20:31] you two or three
- [20:32] or four different use case scenarios
- [20:35] i strongly recommend focusing on on one
- [20:39] um because trying to chase down three or
- [20:41] four in parallel can be hugely dilutive
- [20:45] uh to your to your focus
- [20:49] and at the end of the day there's only
- [20:51] one validate
- [20:53] validation of a customer profile and
- [20:55] that is you
- [20:56] receive purchase orders from different
- [21:00] companies
- [21:01] to solve a similar problem so different
- [21:04] companies
- [21:05] solve a similar problem and by the way
- [21:08] this is
- [21:08] actually from an investor perspective
- [21:11] the bona fide
- [21:12] definition of mvp right you do not
- [21:16] have mvp if you do not have
- [21:19] three or four or six companies that are
- [21:21] different where you're solving a similar
- [21:23] problem so this is your
- [21:27] um your customer profile once you
- [21:31] um once you figure out and fine-tune
- [21:34] your customer profile
- [21:36] now you've got basically the framework
- [21:38] from which you can go out and you can
- [21:40] procure
- [21:41] leads which are the raw material
- [21:44] of sales so i'm going to talk about
- [21:48] the pipeline process now from from lead
- [21:50] to close
- [21:51] where those leads come from how they're
- [21:54] managed throughout the sales process
- [21:58] and how you think about the sales
- [22:00] process
- [22:01] um you know from uh from a stage to
- [22:04] stage
- [22:04] perspective
- [22:08] so sales pipeline here also called a
- [22:11] funnel
- [22:12] it looks like a funnel you've got leads
- [22:14] coming in
- [22:15] the top to suspects
- [22:18] prospects opportunities and customers
- [22:21] suspects are where you um you take
- [22:25] leads and you filter them to meet your
- [22:28] specific
- [22:29] customer profile criteria not all leads
- [22:32] are going to meet that criteria
- [22:34] you need to winnow out the ones that
- [22:37] don't meet that specific criteria
- [22:39] the tighter the criteria the better
- [22:44] moving on prospects are
- [22:48] suspects who you've contacted and
- [22:51] confirmed that the buyer profile
- [22:54] exists within that customer profile
- [22:58] and of the few
- [23:01] prospects that you talk to that meet
- [23:04] that profile
- [23:06] that also express genuine interest
- [23:09] and that the problem that you're solving
- [23:12] is a priority
- [23:13] they become opportunities that you
- [23:16] these are folks that are actively
- [23:18] engaged in your
- [23:19] sales process where you're developing
- [23:21] and closing them
- [23:24] the length of time it takes you to do
- [23:25] this is your sales cycle
- [23:29] and there's these things that occur
- [23:32] between these stages called
- [23:33] conversion metrics um i'll explain in
- [23:36] just a minute why they're
- [23:37] they're very important to you they help
- [23:39] you in sales
- [23:41] uh and there's two things that occur as
- [23:43] part of the sales process that actually
- [23:45] shape this into a funnel
- [23:47] there's triage in attrition
- [23:50] triage is uh you moving people out of
- [23:53] the final
- [23:54] because you don't believe they're
- [23:55] qualified to take your time and
- [23:57] attrition is
- [23:58] people leaving your life kicking you out
- [24:00] of their funnel
- [24:02] because they don't believe you're
- [24:03] qualified to take their time
- [24:07] after you've figured out your customer
- [24:09] uh profile
- [24:10] with your team this is not uh
- [24:14] the top end of your funnel uh the
- [24:16] suspects and prospects is
- [24:18] not where you want to engage your team
- [24:20] they they're very
- [24:21] barely qualified to take your time let
- [24:24] alone people on your team's time
- [24:26] so this is your job as a founder as a
- [24:29] salesperson is to move people
- [24:31] through the suspect prospect conversion
- [24:35] conversely when they make it to
- [24:37] opportunities
- [24:38] the opposite is true this is exactly
- [24:41] where
- [24:42] you need to invest your team's time
- [24:46] and exposure to the customer for lots of
- [24:48] reasons that'll explain
- [24:50] um later on today uh and that is
- [24:54] expanding beyond the one-on-one
- [24:56] conversation
- [24:57] getting getting away from having a
- [25:00] conversation with a single person
- [25:03] uh a prospective customer and
- [25:06] successful successful sales is rather
- [25:09] your ability to connect people on your
- [25:13] team
- [25:13] with people on the buyer's team and the
- [25:15] better you get it that the more likely
- [25:18] you will be having a paying customer
- [25:23] now in a mature company each one
- [25:26] of these stages is actually a formal
- [25:30] highly specialized business discipline
- [25:33] so for example you'll have marketing
- [25:35] people who are responsible
- [25:37] for not only building awareness but also
- [25:40] generating leads and when they generate
- [25:42] leads
- [25:43] which meet the company profile they hand
- [25:46] those over
- [25:47] to inside sales people also
- [25:50] called sales development representatives
- [25:53] or sdrs
- [25:54] and um sdrs they get you know this is
- [25:57] your
- [25:58] a right of passage as a salesperson as a
- [26:00] young sales person you get on the phone
- [26:03] and you just start ambushing people on
- [26:06] the phone and cold calling them
- [26:08] and you know most of your life you're
- [26:10] getting your teeth kicked in but every
- [26:11] once in a while
- [26:12] you'll you'll get somebody where uh it
- [26:15] resonates and when you find somebody
- [26:17] that meets your qualification criteria
- [26:20] the sdr hands that that person off to
- [26:22] field sales
- [26:24] who has a much better well-developed set
- [26:27] of skills
- [26:28] to um develop that opportunity and close
- [26:31] that opportunity
- [26:33] and of course field sales cannot be
- [26:35] burdened by on
- [26:36] ongoing customer retention and
- [26:39] satisfaction
- [26:41] so as soon as practical they transition
- [26:44] the primary relationship in that account
- [26:47] over to an account manager
- [26:49] and uh the field salesperson is the
- [26:51] hunter and the account manager is the
- [26:53] farmer
- [26:54] completely different sales sales
- [26:57] uh skill sets and personalities um
- [27:01] the field sales person is about nuke new
- [27:04] account acquisition
- [27:06] where the farmer the account manager
- [27:08] their job is to maximize the yield
- [27:11] within the account now
- [27:14] for um for founders uh fortunately this
- [27:18] is a lot more simple
- [27:20] for you you don't have to think about
- [27:22] all these roles you get to do them all
- [27:23] yourself
- [27:25] uh but i think it's important to
- [27:27] understand here that behind the scenes
- [27:29] here
- [27:30] uh of all these things that you need to
- [27:33] do as a founder as a small team
- [27:36] this is how you eventually scale your go
- [27:39] to market team
- [27:40] into separate distinct professional
- [27:44] skill sets and roles well the sales
- [27:48] pipeline defines the sequential
- [27:51] named steps of your sales process
- [27:54] that help you organize and
- [27:58] focus your time and also balance your
- [28:00] sales activity and i'll i'm gonna
- [28:03] i'm gonna double back on that balance
- [28:05] here in a moment
- [28:06] because uh it's a very important uh part
- [28:10] of a successful
- [28:12] sales skill set suspects
- [28:16] are filtered leads that meet your
- [28:18] company profile
- [28:20] also called mqls are marketing qualified
- [28:24] leads
- [28:25] prospects are uh initial contact
- [28:29] with that customer verifies that the
- [28:32] buyer profile
- [28:33] and the buyer interest exists this is
- [28:35] also called sales qualified leads or
- [28:38] sqls opportunities
- [28:41] are in your pipeline these are qualified
- [28:45] prospects that are actively engaged in
- [28:47] your sales process
- [28:49] where you are developing the decision
- [28:53] making unit and of course we all know
- [28:55] what customers are these are the
- [28:58] conversion metrics i was
- [29:00] talking about before generally speaking
- [29:03] these are good rule of thumb metrics
- [29:06] here in other words
- [29:07] uh one out of ten suspect becomes a
- [29:10] prospect
- [29:12] um and one in you know one and a half
- [29:16] uh prospect becomes an opportunity
- [29:19] or well maybe uh
- [29:24] 15 of the time and about a third of the
- [29:28] time
- [29:29] you should close an opportunity as a
- [29:31] customer
- [29:32] the point here is they increase they
- [29:34] should intentionally increase
- [29:37] increase left to right right
- [29:40] um if they are not increasing left to
- [29:43] right
- [29:44] significantly um the criteria
- [29:48] that you're employing to
- [29:52] allow people to take up your valuable
- [29:54] time
- [29:55] is uh not well defined enough it's too
- [29:58] broad
- [29:58] and you need to tighten down your uh
- [30:01] your your criteria
- [30:03] um so this will help you debug your
- [30:06] sales process um
- [30:08] and conversion metrics are also uh
- [30:11] one of the few if any
- [30:16] objective metrics uh for sales
- [30:19] forecasting and i'll uh i'll cover that
- [30:22] in just a moment
- [30:24] so a lot of people tend to get um
- [30:27] there's a little confusion
- [30:28] um between mqls and sqls and sales
- [30:32] in interaction between sales and
- [30:34] marketing
- [30:35] so i think about it like how would
- [30:37] somebody how would i want somebody to
- [30:38] explain the difference between these
- [30:40] things to somebody like me
- [30:42] right and the answer here is um mqls
- [30:46] they want to know
- [30:47] what kind of cookies you have and sqls
- [30:50] you verified that they have a ten dollar
- [30:52] budget and they're deciding between thin
- [30:54] mints and oreos
- [30:56] so that's the difference between mqls
- [30:58] and sqls
- [31:01] the law sales starts with the lead
- [31:05] um and in b2c sales by contrast the
- [31:07] websites do all the heavy lifting where
- [31:09] the salesperson supports that
- [31:12] and in b2b sales it's
- [31:15] exactly the opposite um
- [31:18] the the the the b2b
- [31:22] salesperson does all the heavy lifting
- [31:24] and the website is just to support
- [31:27] um websites never close deals
- [31:30] in b2b sales but they're really really
- [31:33] good at preventing them from happening
- [31:35] and i can't tell you how many times
- [31:39] that i've seen early stage entrepreneurs
- [31:42] over build their website and talk
- [31:46] about um
- [31:49] their solution in excruciating detail to
- [31:52] whereas people
- [31:52] visit um and they there's so much
- [31:56] information there
- [31:57] um they're overwhelmed and they don't
- [31:58] really walk away with a clear
- [32:00] understanding of what you do
- [32:02] or worse um they're they overemphasize
- [32:05] the tool and the capabilities and the
- [32:07] features and
- [32:08] they forget about the the why and the
- [32:11] problem and the outcome measures
- [32:14] um there's lots of reasons why websites
- [32:17] um are good at preventing b2b sales
- [32:21] so a couple of things to keep in mind
- [32:23] here you know
- [32:26] diminishing return on people's
- [32:29] attention in sales occurs very early
- [32:32] so you've got basically 30 seconds to
- [32:35] make it really really clear to people
- [32:37] what you sell and how it fits into their
- [32:39] world
- [32:40] speak to their world and just make them
- [32:42] curious to learn more
- [32:44] don't go over engineer the website with
- [32:47] more information because you're never
- [32:49] ever going to have a chance to talk to
- [32:51] them if you provide too much information
- [32:53] on the website
- [32:55] right so it's about your clarity of
- [32:57] thinking here right
- [32:59] uh more concepts illustration very very
- [33:02] crisp
- [33:03] uh messaging right um
- [33:06] and think about your customer right
- [33:09] think about their
- [33:10] world who who are they right is it
- [33:12] really really clear
- [33:14] from your messaging um that
- [33:17] the person visiting your website is
- [33:20] exactly the type of person that you're
- [33:21] serving here
- [33:22] and show this person within 10 seconds
- [33:25] how it directly benefits them
- [33:28] right uh and it's benefits
- [33:31] supported by features and capabilities
- [33:33] not
- [33:34] the reverse so your goal here
- [33:37] is within two or three or maybe five
- [33:40] minutes on the website
- [33:41] is to create somebody who is going to
- [33:44] champion
- [33:45] you to bring you back to the
- [33:47] organization in the context
- [33:49] of an initiative or a project that's
- [33:51] relevant to your offering here
- [33:53] and say hey this is one of the things we
- [33:56] need to look at here
- [33:57] help them sell that story but make them
- [34:01] come back to you for detail
- [34:05] the leads of the raw material of sales
- [34:07] uh there's
- [34:08] uh fundamentally there's two methods
- [34:11] there's outbound leads
- [34:12] and these are um outreach programs
- [34:17] uh two targeted company profiles groups
- [34:20] of prospects to solicit their interest
- [34:23] right there's lots of different very
- [34:26] traditional ways
- [34:27] of doing this and with the advent of the
- [34:30] internet
- [34:30] and especially the development of lots
- [34:33] more advanced
- [34:34] sales and marketing tools especially
- [34:37] over the last 10 years
- [34:40] there's actually a much more efficient
- [34:42] method
- [34:43] of gathering leads called inbound where
- [34:47] search engine optimization and
- [34:49] pay-per-click are how you
- [34:51] acquire new leads they're fundamentally
- [34:54] different approaches
- [34:57] outbound the the prospective
- [35:00] seller initiates the contract uh the
- [35:03] contact with the buyer and
- [35:05] uh in um in inbound seo and ppc
- [35:10] uh the reverse is true the buyer thinks
- [35:12] they reap they find you they reach out
- [35:14] to you they contact you
- [35:17] um because of this people's
- [35:20] needs attention and priorities is
- [35:22] established
- [35:24] in inbound lead generation where it is
- [35:27] not established and outbound
- [35:30] so what kind of skills do you need
- [35:32] depending upon
- [35:34] how you're generating leads you have to
- [35:36] be very good at direct marketing
- [35:39] uh if you're relying on outbound for
- [35:42] primarily for your lead generation
- [35:45] if you're relying on
- [35:48] seo and ppc has to be your skills for
- [35:52] inbound you have to learn about
- [35:54] search engine optimization and keyword
- [35:56] density and metadata
- [35:58] and all the campaigns and obscurities of
- [36:01] figuring out the big
- [36:03] black box of google and how they run
- [36:06] their
- [36:06] algorithms and and all the all the
- [36:10] um the tricks in in
- [36:13] with getting better at driving people to
- [36:15] your website without spending more money
- [36:18] and at the end of the day it does come
- [36:19] down to money your sales economics
- [36:21] and that's why um i'm a big fan of
- [36:24] inbound is because
- [36:26] inbound lead gen once you figure it out
- [36:29] and it will
- [36:30] require quite a bit of the
- [36:31] experimentation but once you figure it
- [36:33] out
- [36:34] the cost to um continue
- [36:37] and grow your company and grow your
- [36:39] revenues
- [36:40] the cost of seo and ppc does not
- [36:44] grow proportionate to your revenue right
- [36:47] it tends to flatten off
- [36:49] in which case your cost of sales goes
- [36:51] down over time wherein
- [36:53] outbound direct marketing the um
- [36:56] the cost of sales tends to be fairly
- [36:59] proportionate to your to your revenue
- [37:02] is a percentage
- [37:05] so um these are the big uh
- [37:09] difference here between the two in terms
- [37:11] of who initiates the contact
- [37:13] and whether people's needs and
- [37:15] priorities are established
- [37:21] outbound uh email campaigns etc
- [37:24] um the the big thing today is to
- [37:27] outsource
- [37:28] your your sdr functions there's actually
- [37:31] quite a few organizations now
- [37:33] in the us uh that will perform this
- [37:37] sdr function for you as a virtual sdr
- [37:41] function if you are going to bring it
- [37:43] in-house
- [37:45] you know their job is to find qualified
- [37:48] prospects
- [37:49] and to have meetings with those people
- [37:53] with your sales people and to have those
- [37:56] meetings convert into paying customers
- [37:59] just a rule of thumb
- [38:00] here on compensating sdrs in-house
- [38:04] is um you um
- [38:08] you you compensate sdrs for both
- [38:10] meetings
- [38:11] but you also compensate them for
- [38:13] conversions and a 1 to 10 ratio
- [38:17] so if you're paying an sdr 25 dollars
- [38:19] every time they get a meeting with your
- [38:21] sales rep they get 250
- [38:24] every time one of those converts to a
- [38:26] paying customer
- [38:30] inbound seo and pay-per-click uh
- [38:33] it requires a significant upfront
- [38:36] investment
- [38:36] in my experience and a lot of ongoing
- [38:40] experimentation to figure out how you
- [38:42] can optimize your spend here
- [38:44] if you have a unique
- [38:48] highly innovative offering and i run
- [38:50] into these all the time at mit
- [38:52] uh it's really important that you
- [38:54] optimize your website
- [38:56] and your seo and ppc spend
- [39:00] around the problem you solve not your
- [39:02] solution
- [39:03] people don't know what your solution is
- [39:06] but they're searching on their problem
- [39:08] so you have to think about it a little
- [39:09] bit differently if
- [39:11] you have a highly innovative offering
- [39:13] and these are
- [39:15] dramatically different approaches
- [39:17] inbound and outbound
- [39:19] right especially in terms of the buyer
- [39:21] seller dynamics
- [39:22] they're both expensive but the
- [39:25] opportunity cost is more expensive you
- [39:27] just have to get in there
- [39:29] a lot of companies experiment with both
- [39:32] the more successful companies that i've
- [39:33] worked with
- [39:34] and developed over the years eventually
- [39:36] become centered on
- [39:37] seo and ppc uh just because of
- [39:41] the the sales economics
- [39:45] so a couple of basic rules for customer
- [39:49] prospecting
- [39:51] um keep your your communication brief
- [39:54] and to the point
- [39:55] in sales as i mentioned before um
- [39:58] diminishing returns on people
- [40:00] attention occurs very uh quickly in
- [40:02] sales
- [40:03] so be very very brief and to the point
- [40:06] and keep your interaction your
- [40:08] interaction with people
- [40:10] in sales narrow and well-defined right
- [40:13] um a big mistake i see
- [40:16] a lot of people make is a founder will
- [40:19] get
- [40:21] somebody that shows good interest and
- [40:23] meets all their
- [40:24] buying criteria on the phone and just
- [40:26] wears them out
- [40:27] over the course of an hour an hour and a
- [40:29] half covering every
- [40:30] one every aspect of their business right
- [40:34] try to resist the temptation of stuffing
- [40:38] multiple steps of your sales process
- [40:40] into a single interaction
- [40:42] lead room for relationship building very
- [40:45] important
- [40:47] also another common mistake you get an
- [40:50] email from somebody that you don't know
- [40:53] asking you to solve their problem and
- [40:55] it's exactly the type of problem that
- [40:57] you solve
- [40:58] do you send them an email um solving
- [41:00] their problem
- [41:01] or show telling them how you would solve
- [41:04] their problem
- [41:05] why is that a lose-lose proposition well
- [41:08] lots of reasons
- [41:10] one is it turns out that despite
- [41:14] years of english class in writing
- [41:18] through grade school and college not too
- [41:20] many people
- [41:21] are great at communicating uh and
- [41:24] writing
- [41:24] especially or people are in hurry and
- [41:27] they give you half the story
- [41:29] or worse they give you the whole story
- [41:31] and you solve it and they have no reason
- [41:33] to contact you right you miss the
- [41:36] opportunity for the person-to-person
- [41:38] interaction so my recommendation
- [41:42] is whenever you get an email and i don't
- [41:44] care what they're asking for
- [41:46] if it's remotely related to sales send
- [41:49] the same response
- [41:51] hey you know what this sounds like
- [41:52] something we can help you with
- [41:55] please send me days times you're
- [41:56] available give them your time zone
- [41:59] and you will confirm a phone call to
- [42:01] discuss
- [42:03] if it's a legitimate interest in your
- [42:05] company
- [42:06] a legitimate prospective buyer 90
- [42:10] of the time you'll get people to respond
- [42:12] back to you affirmatively
- [42:14] with days and times in the following
- [42:16] week this works very very well
- [42:19] right so don't try to don't try to sell
- [42:23] over email get people on zoom get people
- [42:27] on the phone
- [42:30] people have different preferences for
- [42:31] that by the way
- [42:33] try to understand early on what their
- [42:35] preference is
- [42:36] and if you have trouble reaching people
- [42:39] try a little bit
- [42:40] inside and outside of ordinary hours
- [42:43] right um or five minutes before the hour
- [42:47] people tend to be hanging around their
- [42:48] phones if they're playing to make a call
- [42:51] obviously you're not going to be selling
- [42:53] something to people in five minutes but
- [42:54] you can't get on their calendar
- [42:58] this is a pet peeve of mine as a founder
- [43:00] um
- [43:01] especially important when you're small
- [43:03] companies use the word
- [43:04] we instead of i it's very subtle
- [43:07] but it's a very powerful word you want
- [43:10] people you want to give people the
- [43:12] perception they're working with a
- [43:13] company
- [43:14] not an individual so it's very important
- [43:18] that you appear
- [43:19] bigger and more professional than you
- [43:21] actually are
- [43:22] and by using the term we you can
- [43:25] actually
- [43:26] accomplish that when you're prospecting
- [43:30] it's very important to be sensitive to
- [43:33] other people's
- [43:34] time and pressures on the job
- [43:38] sales a lot of sales is about ambushing
- [43:41] people's calendars
- [43:42] and getting on people's calendars where
- [43:44] it's unplanned
- [43:46] and you have to be very mindful and very
- [43:48] gracious
- [43:49] about getting on people's calendars
- [43:51] thanking them
- [43:52] and just saying hey listen we just need
- [43:55] 20 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever but
- [43:57] it's about getting people
- [43:59] on their calendars and respecting the
- [44:01] fact that they're busy and they're
- [44:03] they have lots of different priorities
- [44:05] and making sure that when you do show up
- [44:07] on their calendar and when you do have
- [44:09] an
- [44:09] interaction with them that you add value
- [44:12] with every
- [44:13] interaction right take those phone calls
- [44:16] to ask good questions but
- [44:18] offer people help offer them guidance
- [44:20] offer them insight
- [44:22] right if you provide value
- [44:25] in these conversations people are going
- [44:27] to want to talk to you
- [44:29] right they're not going to talk to you
- [44:31] out of obligation
- [44:33] they're not going to talk to you out of
- [44:34] courtesy they're going to talk to you
- [44:36] because you've been helpful
- [44:40] um and it's important to be serious
- [44:43] about your business it's important to be
- [44:45] serious about your product just don't
- [44:47] take yourself too seriously
- [44:49] in sales right um sales can be anxious
- [44:53] enough right try to keep your manner
- [44:56] your tone
- [44:57] light um i call this the behavioral
- [45:00] equivalent of office casual dress code
- [45:03] right um you know
- [45:06] be a little bit more relaxed i think
- [45:08] helps other people
- [45:10] uh become relaxed and you can be very
- [45:13] formal and professional
- [45:15] about your knowledge and your competence
- [45:17] and the information
- [45:18] you share to help people but you don't
- [45:19] have to be so formal
- [45:21] in terms of your manner in your in your
- [45:24] tone
- [45:25] and always afford people and out and see
- [45:28] if they take it
- [45:29] i'm a big fan of this i think
- [45:32] on thursday we're going to be talking a
- [45:35] lot about
- [45:37] some very specific skills um
- [45:40] what i call off ramps to help people
- [45:42] opt-in or opt out of your sales process
- [45:46] to actually solicit clear buying
- [45:49] installing signals that are
- [45:51] actionable by you because
- [45:54] otherwise people may have their own
- [45:56] agenda and not
- [45:57] wish to send you these signals so it's
- [46:00] important for you as a salesperson to
- [46:02] have these skills and ability
- [46:04] to to um to help people
- [46:08] either opt in or opt out of your your
- [46:10] process
- [46:11] now of course we all have bad days and
- [46:14] um
- [46:15] you know as it turns out when you're
- [46:16] working uh in sales
- [46:18] um the further you go in the
- [46:20] conversation the more expensive they
- [46:22] come
- [46:22] and sometimes you arrive at work uh and
- [46:25] you just feel like well you've got to
- [46:27] get the job done but you're not
- [46:28] quite on that day my
- [46:32] my another strong recommendation that
- [46:35] i've learned
- [46:35] just from my own experience
- [46:40] doing sales is you know when you're
- [46:42] having those bad days
- [46:44] don't interact with people in sales you
- [46:47] know go to the movies
- [46:48] don't interact with any humans and when
- [46:50] you're having those positive mojo days
- [46:52] that's when you make those important
- [46:54] calls
- [46:58] so a couple of basic rules
- [47:01] of customer prospecting law number one
- [47:04] you're going to interact with a hundred
- [47:06] prospects
- [47:07] for every one of the three that close
- [47:09] and at the outset they all
- [47:10] appear the same and there are no
- [47:13] shortcuts
- [47:14] right you must touch everyone determine
- [47:16] who's real
- [47:19] and to my earlier point prospects
- [47:22] who are great fit they're easy to spot
- [47:26] it's the ones that are not a good fit
- [47:28] that are more difficult to spot
- [47:30] so there's a couple of things to think
- [47:33] about there
- [47:34] in terms of how you how you go about
- [47:36] that
- [47:42] prospecting law 4 you're always
- [47:46] going to have to make decisions in sales
- [47:49] with an
- [47:49] incomplete set of information right
- [47:52] which is anathema
- [47:54] to the engineering mindset if you don't
- [47:56] have a complete set of information it
- [47:58] won't compile
- [48:00] right in sales
- [48:03] over analyzing something belaboring
- [48:06] incomplete knowledge will not help you
- [48:09] you must learn to trust your instinct
- [48:11] and take
- [48:12] action on what you feel is important
- [48:15] you have to feel confident about moving
- [48:17] as confident about moving people
- [48:20] out of your pipeline as you do forward
- [48:22] in your pipeline
- [48:26] and you've been working on a deal for a
- [48:27] while it doesn't
- [48:29] they've decided to go in a different
- [48:30] direction you just don't dwell upon them
- [48:33] you've got your little
- [48:34] uh w3 c
- [48:37] cubed over n uh poster
- [48:41] in your office there and you're just
- [48:43] like
- [48:45] no no problem um
- [48:49] timing is also a big challenge in sales
- [48:53] here
- [48:55] and it's actually an enigma in sales
- [48:58] because it's very very different
- [49:00] difficult to manage one of the ways that
- [49:02] i've
- [49:03] developed over years as a way of
- [49:05] thinking about timing is
- [49:07] is treating your expensive opportunities
- [49:10] in your pipeline like perishable food
- [49:13] so for example there's these deals that
- [49:15] you know are going to make a decision
- [49:18] in the next days or weeks inside a month
- [49:22] these have to be out on your kitchen
- [49:24] table
- [49:25] they're going to be a meal for somebody
- [49:27] they're going to make a decision
- [49:29] they're going to buy from somebody maybe
- [49:30] not you but this meal is going to get
- [49:32] eaten
- [49:33] right and you need to pay attention to
- [49:35] it and they get more touches
- [49:37] more more of your time versus those
- [49:40] things in the refrigerator
- [49:42] where the decision um date might be a
- [49:44] little bit further out
- [49:46] next couple months the next next couple
- [49:48] quarters
- [49:49] right where instead of two to three
- [49:51] touches a week it's more one to two
- [49:53] touches a month
- [49:54] versus those things that are in the
- [49:56] freezer that are not actively driving
- [49:59] toward a decision date but you may be
- [50:02] helping to influence something in the
- [50:04] next year's budget
- [50:05] where you need to you need to touch base
- [50:07] with them every three to six months
- [50:09] certainly not
- [50:10] months and certainly not weeks or
- [50:13] days so these are
- [50:17] all fully quali these are all fully
- [50:20] qualified opportunity the only
- [50:22] difference here is timing
- [50:24] right and the frequency of your
- [50:27] sales activity so highly perishable
- [50:31] deals
- [50:32] two to three a week one to two a month
- [50:35] and three to six months so the reality
- [50:38] in sales is you're getting up in the
- [50:40] morning
- [50:40] you're looking at your pipeline first
- [50:42] thing you do is you open the
- [50:43] refrigerator
- [50:44] you say okay what are we going to eat
- [50:47] this week or next week
- [50:49] and what belongs in the freezer stuff
- [50:51] you've been
- [50:52] you've been pawn through in your
- [50:54] pipeline for too long it's not closing
- [50:56] uh you put that in your freezer for your
- [50:58] drip campaign or
- [50:59] something else it's still a qualified
- [51:01] deal it's just a timing issue maybe they
- [51:04] pushed it off a year
- [51:06] uh and always you're alert to those
- [51:08] things which are sending short-term
- [51:10] buying signals where you have to really
- [51:12] focus your attention on you you'll do
- [51:15] the best job you possibly can
- [51:18] in sort of organizing your deals around
- [51:21] timing
- [51:22] but the reality is you're going to
- [51:24] uncover a lot
- [51:26] of opportunities that send you strong
- [51:29] buying signals
- [51:30] and go nowhere and to the contrary
- [51:33] you're going to encounter
- [51:34] opportunities that you swear are a
- [51:36] perfect fit
- [51:37] or are not a perfect fit um and you
- [51:41] scratch their head and they decide that
- [51:43] they want to become your customer
- [51:45] and the timing of course is a mystery
- [51:48] right uh especially when you don't have
- [51:51] a way of thinking about a way of
- [51:52] managing it
- [51:54] so in sales there's only so much on your
- [51:58] influence and control and it much is up
- [52:01] much in sales is up to many other things
- [52:05] way outside your control you just can't
- [52:08] fret over the unpredictable nature of
- [52:10] sales because you have to control your
- [52:12] attitude and your behavior
- [52:14] so with the few minutes left that we
- [52:16] have here today i want to
- [52:19] just talk about a little bit about
- [52:22] um attitude and behavior and give you
- [52:24] some examples
- [52:26] uh for team sales and communication here
- [52:28] and then
- [52:30] um i don't know what people's time
- [52:32] frames are but i'm
- [52:33] kind of um i'm going to run over the
- [52:35] time here and give you some
- [52:36] time to ask some q a at the end here joe
- [52:39] so
- [52:40] in case that's uh needed so
- [52:43] um in my experience working with
- [52:46] and at many startups in my career
- [52:51] um in sales attitude and behavior are
- [52:54] the two
- [52:55] best predictors of sales success
- [52:58] and you know the um the
- [53:01] uh efficiency uh and performance are the
- [53:05] are basically mutually exclu exclusive
- [53:08] uh in in most professions the faster
- [53:11] you do it the uh the lower the quality
- [53:15] and vice versa
- [53:17] sales is the same you want to be very
- [53:19] efficient but
- [53:20] you get diminishing returns on
- [53:21] efficiency on your
- [53:24] performance so the most efficient sales
- [53:26] person
- [53:27] is the pusher
- [53:30] this person they drive aggressively
- [53:33] toward a yes or no
- [53:36] and they're extremely efficient at doing
- [53:38] that
- [53:40] they're not very helpful in fact well
- [53:42] they'll help you
- [53:43] they'll help you borrow their pen to
- [53:45] sign an agreement
- [53:47] uh i i checked that that's about it
- [53:50] the extent to which they'll help you
- [53:52] right but they're all about driving
- [53:54] people to purpose
- [53:55] uh to purchase their performance is
- [53:58] is lousy but they're the most efficient
- [54:00] sales people on the planet
- [54:03] next ball on the line is what i call the
- [54:05] dreamer the hoper and the dreamer
- [54:07] this is the person that uh active
- [54:10] they're not quite sure how to help
- [54:11] people but they're always hopeful and
- [54:13] optimistic
- [54:15] um and you can tell a hoper and dreamer
- [54:17] because they have a bloated pipeline
- [54:20] right so instead of uh you know a
- [54:23] hundred
- [54:24] um prospects in opportunities they're
- [54:27] working they may have
- [54:28] 400 people in the pipeline because
- [54:30] they're too afraid
- [54:31] to throw something out for it not uh
- [54:35] they're wishing and hoping versus being
- [54:37] proactive
- [54:39] the mechanic is the next step in the
- [54:41] process this is the person that
- [54:44] is more skilled and that will
- [54:47] recognize the absence of buying signals
- [54:50] and feel
- [54:51] quite comfortable about moving on and
- [54:53] put putting somebody
- [54:54] outside of their their scope of activity
- [54:58] and then lastly is the facilitator and
- [55:01] this is the person that's mastered
- [55:03] in helping prospects sell themselves
- [55:07] or opt out this is not a sales person
- [55:11] this is a facilitator this is somebody
- [55:14] that's working with people and asking
- [55:16] the right questions and people either
- [55:18] sell themselves or they don't that's a
- [55:21] very different type of sales animal
- [55:25] so attitude and behavior the two best
- [55:28] predictors of sales success
- [55:31] remember it's not b2b
- [55:34] it's not b2c sales is about p2p
- [55:37] person to person people
- [55:40] buy from people not from companies right
- [55:44] and because of that salespeople often
- [55:46] make
- [55:47] a huge error of jumping directly
- [55:50] into problem solving mode by impressing
- [55:54] people of their knowledge and how they
- [55:55] good
- [55:56] are good at solving their problems
- [55:59] right buyers however often can find that
- [56:02] threatening and are reluctant
- [56:04] to have you solve their problem until
- [56:06] that empathy and trust and establish
- [56:08] and i don't know how many folks on the
- [56:10] online here are married this is a lesson
- [56:13] i learned from my wife 20 years ago
- [56:15] it was a hard lesson that when she
- [56:18] would explain a problem to me if i
- [56:20] jumped into fix
- [56:21] mode it usually had a really really
- [56:24] horrible outcome
- [56:25] and all i had to sit back when and just
- [56:27] say i really understand your pain
- [56:30] and i was in a much better position
- [56:32] doing that than trying to fix it
- [56:34] sales is very similar right resist the
- [56:37] temptation
- [56:39] to fix people's problems and convince
- [56:42] them
- [56:42] that you really understand their problem
- [56:45] and that you have their best
- [56:47] interests in mind so i'm going to talk
- [56:49] about that the four pillars of building
- [56:52] a successful buyer seller relationship
- [56:56] starts with empathy convincing people
- [56:59] you truly
- [57:00] understand their need and their pain
- [57:04] which leads to trust right you
- [57:07] have their best interest in mind which
- [57:10] means as part of the sales process
- [57:12] hey listen i'm going to ask you some
- [57:14] questions
- [57:15] uh you know if it turns out that i don't
- [57:18] think we can help you or you're not the
- [57:20] best fit for me
- [57:21] believe me i will be the first to raise
- [57:23] my hand and if i can
- [57:25] i'm going to point you in another
- [57:26] direction i know a lot of other vendors
- [57:29] in this space
- [57:30] or other people i just want to make sure
- [57:32] you get something that's
- [57:34] the best for you right you have to
- [57:36] convince people
- [57:37] that um you are serving their
- [57:40] best interest empathy and trust is the
- [57:44] foundation
- [57:45] of sales once you establish that
- [57:48] foundation then you can begin to express
- [57:52] the value of their offering
- [57:57] in their terms in their world
- [58:00] not your value proposition but their
- [58:03] value proposition
- [58:04] how is your product valuable what is the
- [58:07] outcome measure
- [58:08] of your offering in their word world and
- [58:12] their terms
- [58:14] and then finally if they buy into that
- [58:16] and they say yeah that's exactly
- [58:18] the outcome that we're looking for then
- [58:21] you can move on to competence
- [58:23] right you can talk about your product
- [58:25] and your team and how you're capable
- [58:28] and you're up to the task
- [58:31] these are the four pillars of building a
- [58:33] successful buyer relationship
- [58:35] too often i i see people
- [58:38] uh going in the reverse direction and
- [58:41] attempting to build a relationship
- [58:43] backwards by
- [58:44] trying to convince people of um how
- [58:47] knowledgeable they are
- [58:48] or talking feature function and value
- [58:51] prop
- [58:51] and whatever that's backwards that's a
- [58:54] fatal error
- [58:55] in sales start with empathy and trust
- [58:57] build toward value in their terms
- [59:00] and earn the right uh to
- [59:03] share how competent you are jumping
- [59:05] straight
- [59:06] to the fix for your capabilities it's
- [59:09] often viewed as dismissive
- [59:10] of their unique circumstances think
- [59:14] about it
- [59:14] right so your strengths right
- [59:18] become a gift only after people are
- [59:20] convinced that you really understand
- [59:23] their specific unique needs and have
- [59:26] their best interest
- [59:27] in mind and in the absence of that trust
- [59:30] right your competence understand
- [59:33] your competence can be viewed as
- [59:35] insulting
- [59:36] or aggressive right you mean oh
- [59:40] i've been suffering over this for nine
- [59:42] months and you're gonna solve it in two
- [59:43] minutes
- [59:44] how dumb am i or you know what i haven't
- [59:47] told you the whole story yet
- [59:49] you're trying to fix it you've only got
- [59:51] a quarter of the story
- [59:52] right so think about your approach here
- [59:55] in sales competence
- [59:57] is always valued but it's usually
- [59:59] measured last
- [01:00:04] after several interactions look for a
- [01:00:06] shift in the prospect's attitude from
- [01:00:08] selmy
- [01:00:09] to let's solve this together
- [01:00:13] and if you've attempted and you've
- [01:00:14] established trust
- [01:00:16] and you've established empathy but still
- [01:00:19] fail to win the deal
- [01:00:21] don't personalize the rejection right
- [01:00:24] it's a numbers
- [01:00:25] driven game it's not a referendum on
- [01:00:28] your knowledge or ability it's just the
- [01:00:30] wrong company
- [01:00:30] wrong person bad timing take your pick
- [01:00:36] i've got a couple more slides here joe
- [01:00:38] then we can move to some q a is that all
- [01:00:40] right
- [01:00:41] sure sure go ahead go okay um i said at
- [01:00:44] the outset here that sales is not about
- [01:00:47] picking winners or
- [01:00:48] losers and i'll i'll give you a couple
- [01:00:50] of examples why
- [01:00:52] uh if you're a top opportunity focus
- [01:00:55] salesperson
- [01:00:56] you spend 90 to 100 of your time chasing
- [01:01:00] down the two or three deals that you
- [01:01:01] feel are most likely to close
- [01:01:03] and you're ignoring everything else in
- [01:01:05] your funnel you're ignoring new leads or
- [01:01:07] ignoring developing leads and
- [01:01:08] opportunities
- [01:01:10] and this is what your life is going to
- [01:01:12] look like it's going to look like
- [01:01:13] groundhog day
- [01:01:15] right because by the time you put all
- [01:01:17] the effort in to close that deal
- [01:01:19] you'll disremember everything else in
- [01:01:21] your pipeline or
- [01:01:23] it's gone in another direction so
- [01:01:26] you get you you get the deal you win
- [01:01:28] some you lose some
- [01:01:30] but it's up and down and it's groundhog
- [01:01:33] versus
- [01:01:34] a balanced sales activity where you
- [01:01:36] invest
- [01:01:37] half your time in those top deals and
- [01:01:40] you distribute the other half your time
- [01:01:42] amongst the other different areas of
- [01:01:44] your pipeline
- [01:01:45] developing the rest of the funnel
- [01:01:48] qualifying moving prospects to suspects
- [01:01:52] nurturing other people in your pipeline
- [01:01:56] uh and when you are disciplined to
- [01:01:59] balance
- [01:01:59] your sales activity this is what your
- [01:02:02] cash flow this is what your life
- [01:02:04] will look like you're not going to have
- [01:02:06] those huge peaks that you will
- [01:02:08] if you were to invest 100 of your time
- [01:02:11] but eventually what you're giving up
- [01:02:13] here is the first six months
- [01:02:15] of those peaks for a sustainable
- [01:02:20] revenue performance over time
- [01:02:23] and there's one thing i learned very
- [01:02:24] early in startups there's this cool
- [01:02:26] thing called running out of money
- [01:02:28] that's a great reminder that um chasing
- [01:02:32] uh deals 100 of the time is not a good
- [01:02:35] idea
- [01:02:37] so balance your sales activity across
- [01:02:39] each stage of the pipeline
- [01:02:40] unbalanced sales activity is risky and
- [01:02:44] unsustainable don't assume who will
- [01:02:46] close
- [01:02:47] come up with your own sales discipline
- [01:02:49] and rhythm and what happens
- [01:02:51] is this very cool thing in pipelines
- [01:02:53] when you start to invest
- [01:02:55] all your positive energy into that
- [01:02:57] pipeline without any
- [01:02:59] misconception or preconception of what
- [01:03:03] might win and what might not is the
- [01:03:06] deals that come out
- [01:03:07] come out of the strangest places that
- [01:03:09] you never expect
- [01:03:11] and it's the result of this positive
- [01:03:13] value that accumulates
- [01:03:15] in your pipeline over time so it's kind
- [01:03:18] of like watching grass grow or paint
- [01:03:20] drying
- [01:03:21] right it's hard to observe but they both
- [01:03:23] always do
- [01:03:27] lastly for today i want to talk about
- [01:03:30] evangelism
- [01:03:32] i see a lot of people especially with
- [01:03:34] highly innovative offerings
- [01:03:36] evangelizing people over their
- [01:03:39] product i don't believe that evangelism
- [01:03:42] is part of sales
- [01:03:44] i like to leave that up to marketing
- [01:03:46] here so if you find yourself
- [01:03:48] educating somebody in the very basics of
- [01:03:50] what you
- [01:03:51] uh do they are not qualified to take
- [01:03:54] your time
- [01:03:54] don't invest your time training people
- [01:03:57] by the way
- [01:03:58] people will give you buying signals just
- [01:04:00] to get trained for free
- [01:04:02] and then walk away if the business case
- [01:04:06] how your product fits into their
- [01:04:08] organization from a workflow or use case
- [01:04:11] perspective
- [01:04:12] is not obvious they're not qualified to
- [01:04:14] take your time
- [01:04:16] don't attempt to reinvent their business
- [01:04:21] if the scale of the problem does not
- [01:04:24] support your price
- [01:04:25] they're not qualified to take your time
- [01:04:27] you could be solving a problem
- [01:04:29] for an individual or a small group or a
- [01:04:31] department but if that doesn't support
- [01:04:33] your time
- [01:04:35] uh your price then they're not qualified
- [01:04:39] and then lastly is it a priority do they
- [01:04:41] believe the problem is
- [01:04:43] worth solving don't attempt to
- [01:04:46] change people's priorities so do not
- [01:04:49] invest your precious time
- [01:04:51] educating the ill-informed or convincing
- [01:04:54] skeptics
- [01:04:55] invest your time converting
- [01:04:56] knowledgeable people into customers
- [01:05:00] when a prospect does not readily
- [01:05:01] understand the value
- [01:05:04] the problem you solve move up or move on
- [01:05:09] um i think that's uh i could continue
- [01:05:12] here joe i've got some other stuff uh
- [01:05:19] thanks so much ken that was i mean
- [01:05:20] amazing so many great comments in the
- [01:05:22] chat and
- [01:05:23] uh some some folks that have listened to
- [01:05:25] you in the past that came back to
- [01:05:27] again i listened to someone from mass
- [01:05:29] challenge
- [01:05:30] so i think we can we can stop here
- [01:05:34] there's a lot of questions i mean we
- [01:05:35] could have a whole session on
- [01:05:37] just uh you know the participants
- [01:05:39] questions but i'll pick i'll pick three
- [01:05:41] uh maybe if you have a couple minutes uh
- [01:05:44] to just go through them so
- [01:05:46] uh kwame is asking he's saying the viral
- [01:05:48] network and network effects are
- [01:05:50] buzzwords in
- [01:05:52] b2c marketing what are some in b2b
- [01:05:55] examples well guess what the same thing
- [01:05:59] occurs in business to businesses it does
- [01:06:02] the viral sort of the network effect you
- [01:06:05] know you go
- [01:06:06] into an industry and especially as a
- [01:06:08] startup
- [01:06:09] you're in awe of how big and vast the
- [01:06:12] industry is
- [01:06:13] and then what you discover over a career
- [01:06:16] is how small and tight-knit
- [01:06:18] it really is right so the word gets
- [01:06:21] around
- [01:06:22] right on best practices great vendors
- [01:06:25] that you can trust
- [01:06:27] etc etc so even companies
- [01:06:30] people in different cultures you know
- [01:06:34] hr people hang out with hr people
- [01:06:37] operations people hang out
- [01:06:38] with ops people and other companies same
- [01:06:40] thing with sales and marketing
- [01:06:43] industries are much smaller than you
- [01:06:45] might think they
- [01:06:46] they appear huge but in the reputation
- [01:06:50] uh that you establish within an industry
- [01:06:53] through reference
- [01:06:54] customers and great partner
- [01:06:55] relationships uh
- [01:06:57] is is just is visceral
- [01:07:00] just as real as the um
- [01:07:04] the the networking effect that you get
- [01:07:06] in b2c it just
- [01:07:08] happens a different way great uh next
- [01:07:11] question from christopher he's asking
- [01:07:12] what are some signals that
- [01:07:14] someone is just looking for competitive
- [01:07:15] intelligence
- [01:07:17] oh uh i call that peter the pocket
- [01:07:20] picker
- [01:07:21] right right
- [01:07:24] uh and christopher how are you dushane i
- [01:07:28] recognize you

- [01:07:35] picking your pocket
- [01:07:36] for competitive intelligence you know
- [01:07:39] they're asking you
- [01:07:39] great questions and they're very
- [01:07:41] knowledgeable but you don't think
- [01:07:43] they're going to be a buyer
- [01:07:44] you have to draw the line there and you
- [01:07:46] have to ask them questions about
- [01:07:49] their project and their project timeline
- [01:07:52] and what they're actually
- [01:07:53] doing and is it a real project or are
- [01:07:55] they just picking your
