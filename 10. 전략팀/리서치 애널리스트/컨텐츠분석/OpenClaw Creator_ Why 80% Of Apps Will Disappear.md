## Key insight / summary

- **로컬 실행의 혁신적 가치**: OpenClaw가 폭발적으로 성장한 핵심은 클라우드가 아닌 사용자 컴퓨터에서 직접 실행되어 "모든 것"을 제어할 수 있다는 점 (Tesla, 오븐, 조명, Sonos 등 모든 연결된 기기 제어 가능)

- **예상치 못한 창발적 능력**: 개발자가 구체적으로 프로그래밍하지 않았음에도 AI가 음성 파일을 자동으로 감지하고, 헤더를 분석하고, ffmpeg로 변환하고, OpenAI API로 전사하는 전체 워크플로우를 9초 만에 해결

- **앱의 대량 소멸 예측**: 80%의 앱이 사라질 것으로 전망 - MyFitnessPal, 할 일 앱 등 데이터 관리형 앱들은 에이전트가 자연스럽게 대체할 것 (센서가 있는 앱만 생존 가능)

- **Bot-to-Bot 경제의 출현**: 사용자의 봇이 레스토랑 봇과 협상하거나, 봇이 인간을 고용해서 오프라인 업무를 처리하는 새로운 상호작용 패턴 등장

- **전문화된 에이전트 생태계**: 개인용, 업무용, 관계 관리용 등 여러 전문 봇이 협력하는 "군집 지능(swarm intelligence)" 모델로의 진화

- **코딩과 실세계 문제해결의 연결**: 코딩 모델이 뛰어난 이유는 창의적 문제해결 능력이 코드뿐만 아니라 실세계 업무에도 동일하게 적용되기 때문

- **자연스러운 대화형 인터페이스**: 터미널, 세션, 폴더, 모델을 신경쓰지 않고 "친구와 대화하듯이" 상호작용할 수 있는 UX가 핵심

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **로컬 실행 능력 강화 필요**: OpenClaw처럼 Proby도 사용자 환경에서 직접 실행되어 기존 리서치 도구들(Miro, Notion, Slack 등)과 네이티브 통합할 수 있는 아키텍처 구축 → 클라우드 기반 경쟁사들 대비 "모든 것을 제어할 수 있는" 차별점 확보

- **창발적 리서치 워크플로우 설계**: 연구자가 명시적으로 요청하지 않아도 AI가 참가자 데이터를 분석하여 숨겨진 패턴을 발견하고, 적절한 후속 질문을 자동 생성하는 기능 개발 → 전략문서의 "AI 조절 품질이 인간과 동등하다"는 가정을 넘어서는 가치 창출

- **에이전트 간 협업 생태계 구축**: Proby가 다른 AI 에이전트들(고객사의 CRM 봇, 마케팅 봇 등)과 협업하여 리서치 결과를 자동으로 실행 가능한 인사이트로 전환하는 기능 → 단순한 "moderated survey platform"을 넘어 전체 조직의 의사결정 허브로 진화

- **자연스러운 대화형 리서치 경험**: 복잡한 설정 없이 "참가자 10명과 브랜딩에 대해 대화하고 싶어"라고 말하면 모든 것이 자동으로 설정되는 UX 구현 → 전략문서의 스타트업 PM/PD 세그먼트 공략에 핵심적

- **전문화된 리서치 에이전트 제공**: 유니콘 기업용 글로벌 리서치 봇, 스타트업용 빠른 검증 봇, 엔터프라이즈용 규정 준수 봇 등으로 세분화 → 전략문서의 세그먼트별 차별화 전략을 에이전트 레벨에서 구현

- **80% 앱 소멸 대응 전략**: 기존 리서치 도구들(UserTesting, Survey Monkey 등)이 사라질 것을 전제로, 이들의 핵심 기능을 Proby 에이전트가 자연스럽게 흡수하는 로드맵 수립 → 경쟁 분석에서 누락된 "미래 경쟁 지형" 선점

- **토큰 사용량을 장점으로 전환**: "사용자들이 너무 많이 써서 토큰을 태운다"는 것을 품질 지표로 활용 → 전략문서의 LTV:CAC 모델에서 높은 사용량을 고객 만족도와 retention의 선행지표로 활용

- **Bot-to-Human 하이브리드 모델**: AI가 처리할 수 없는 복잡한 리서치는 자동으로 전문 리서처를 섭외하고 협업하는 시스템 구축 → 전략문서의 "AI 품질 우려"를 해결하면서 확장성 확보

- [00:00] Today I'm sitting down with Peter
- [00:01] Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw,
- [00:03] the open- source personal AI agent that
- [00:06] has completely taken over the internet.
- [00:08] The GitHub repo exploded to over 160,000
- [00:12] stars practically overnight. [music] The
- [00:14] community has built countless projects
- [00:16] like Maltbook where bots talk among
- [00:18] themselves. And now the bots are even
- [00:21] renting humans to do tasks in the real
- [00:23] world. In our conversation, we discuss
- [00:25] his aha moment, his contrarian
- [00:28] development philosophies, and what this
- [00:30] means for builders in 2026. Let's dive
- [00:33] in. [music]
- [00:38] >> So, good to see you, man.
- [00:39] >> Hey, what's up?
- [00:40] >> Um, so you've made something people
- [00:43] want,
- [00:44] >> it seems. So,
- [00:45] >> yeah. Uh, Open Claw, as it's called now,
- [00:47] has absolutely
- [00:48] >> name number five. Yeah. [laughter]
- [00:50] >> Has been absolutely exploding the
- [00:52] internet. Um, how have the past one or
- [00:55] two weeks been for you, man?
- [00:57] >> Oh my god. I need like I need a cave.
- [01:00] [laughter]
- [01:01] A week of solitude.
- [01:03] >> You You came out of the cave and you
- [01:04] want to go back to the cave like a like
- [01:06] little lobster.
- [01:07] >> It's been absolutely wild. I don't know
- [01:08] how one human can absorb all of that. I
- [01:11] probably need another week just to like
- [01:13] respond to all my emails. Uh, I got some
- [01:15] incredibly cool stuff. I got some
- [01:17] incredibly
- [01:19] bad stuff.
- [01:20] >> [snorts]
- [01:20] >> Um, but clearly I hit something that
- [01:24] sprew up emotions and made people
- [01:26] interested and inspired people and it's
- [01:28] really cool.
- [01:28] >> And a lot of people have been working
- [01:30] on, you know, AI and even personal
- [01:32] assistance. Like what what is it that
- [01:34] made Open Claw take off?
- [01:36] >> I think my big difference is that it
- [01:38] actually runs on your computer. Like
- [01:41] every everything I saw so far runs in
- [01:42] the cloud. It's like it can do a few
- [01:45] things if you run on your computer. It
- [01:48] can do every effing thing, right? So
- [01:52] that's way more powerful.
- [01:53] >> Yeah. Machine can do anything that you
- [01:55] can do with the machine.
- [01:56] >> You can just connect to your oven or
- [01:59] your Tesla or your lights, your Sonos.
- [02:03] My bad. It can control the temperature
- [02:04] of my bed. JPD can't do that.
- [02:07] >> You gave it all the skills that you have
- [02:09] yourself. A friend told me like he
- [02:11] installed Open Claw and
- [02:15] it and then it asked it like look
- [02:17] through my computer and make a narrative
- [02:19] over my last year and it made this
- [02:22] incredibly good narrative and he was
- [02:23] like how did you do that
- [02:26] and then he the open cloth found audio
- [02:29] files where like every Sunday he was
- [02:31] recording stuff and openclaw found that
- [02:35] but he didn't even remember about it
- [02:36] because it was like more than a year ago
- [02:38] right so So just by it being able to
- [02:41] search a whole computer, it it can
- [02:45] surprise you.
- [02:46] >> It's also
- [02:48] you also give it all the data, right? So
- [02:49] it can surprise you in many ways.
- [02:52] >> And so now you have, you know, we're
- [02:54] even moving from human tobot. So like
- [02:56] interactions and you've been talking
- [02:58] about tobottobot
- [03:00] interactions or even like bot to other
- [03:03] humans where you know bots on behalf of
- [03:05] you are then hiring other humans to
- [03:07] accomplish tasks IRL like what's
- [03:11] happening
- [03:12] >> I think that's a natural next step like
- [03:15] okay I want to book a restaurant my bot
- [03:18] will reach out to the restaurant bot and
- [03:21] do the negotiation
- [03:23] like because it's more efficient Or or
- [03:27] maybe it's like an old restaurant. So my
- [03:28] bot needs to actually get some some
- [03:30] human work done so that the human then
- [03:32] calls the restaurant because they don't
- [03:34] like bots
- [03:35] >> or walks there to stand in line
- [03:37] >> if he doesn't get a robot for
- [03:38] >> or the owner of the bot. [laughter]
- [03:41] >> And I imagine that like maybe if if I
- [03:44] have even multiple bots like maybe I
- [03:46] have like specialist one is like for my
- [03:48] private life and one is for like my
- [03:50] person my my work stuff. Maybe one is
- [03:52] our relationship bot that gets like
- [03:54] everything in between. Uh I don't know.
- [03:57] We're so early. There's still so much so
- [04:00] many things that we haven't really
- [04:02] figured out if it actually works. Um but
- [04:05] I feel we are we are on the timeline
- [04:07] now.
- [04:07] >> It seems like everyone was chasing sort
- [04:09] of like the sort of like centralized god
- [04:11] intelligence and what has sort of
- [04:13] emerged over the past you know 10 days
- [04:15] or so is sort of like the swarm
- [04:17] intelligence um and and the community
- [04:19] intelligence. I think that if you look
- [04:21] at one human being,
- [04:24] what can one human being actually
- [04:26] achieve? Do you think one human being
- [04:27] could make an iPhone or one human being
- [04:29] could go to space?
- [04:31] One human being would probably just like
- [04:33] not even be able to like find food.
- [04:36] Um, but as a group we specialize as a
- [04:41] larger society we specialize even more.
- [04:45] So, what can we learn from that that we
- [04:48] can apply to AI? You know, we we already
- [04:50] have like AI that specializes in certain
- [04:53] things. Um, even though it's it's
- [04:55] generalized intelligence, what if it
- [04:57] actually is also specialized
- [04:59] intelligence?
- [05:01] So, I it's going to be very exciting,
- [05:03] cool.
- [05:03] >> Yeah. You kind of like opened a window
- [05:05] into the future and now a ton of people
- [05:07] are kind of like building building on it
- [05:08] and have sort of like their aha moment.
- [05:11] Um, can you walk me back to when you had
- [05:13] your aha moment and can like re recount
- [05:15] that very moment?
- [05:16] >> I wanted something to like just type
- [05:18] stuff so my computer would do stuff like
- [05:21] very simple. And then I built I built a
- [05:24] version of that in May, June that was
- [05:27] cool but wasn't really it. Um,
- [05:31] and then I built a whole bunch of other
- [05:32] stuff and kind of like build up my army.
- [05:37] And then in November,
- [05:40] there was a day where I wanted this
- [05:41] again. Like I I went to the kitchen and
- [05:44] all I wanted was check up if my computer
- [05:46] would still do stuff or being finished
- [05:49] >> and doing stuff was was coding. You were
- [05:51] coding stuff.
- [05:52] >> Yeah, of course.
- [05:52] >> Were you coding something else or were
- [05:55] you coding the thing itself?
- [05:57] >> No, no, that was just like the need was
- [06:00] again there and I'm like,
- [06:01] >> what were you coding at the time? What
- [06:03] were you building? My god. You see my my
- [06:05] GitHub is like it's like 40 projects. I
- [06:07] don't even know. Um I think it was
- [06:10] summarize.
- [06:11] It's like a it's like a little CLI app
- [06:14] where you can give it whatever like a
- [06:16] podcast or um a hot seat thing like here
- [06:19] and it would summarize it but it also
- [06:21] show you the slides in the terminal cuz
- [06:23] you can do that nowadays. Yeah. You can
- [06:24] just do things.
- [06:25] >> So for the love of the computer you kind
- [06:27] of like started messing with stuff.
- [06:29] >> Um you came out of retirement actually,
- [06:31] right? um to sort like mess with AI and
- [06:34] then increasingly you were so hooked
- [06:36] that you wanted to just do it always
- [06:37] also on the go with the phone.
- [06:39] >> I mean the last project I I worked two
- [06:42] months on Wipe Tunnel
- [06:44] >> to the point where it got so good that I
- [06:46] was catching myself always like coding
- [06:49] next to my when I was at my friends and
- [06:51] I like I need to stop this this is like
- [06:52] too addictive. And then in November and
- [06:55] like my need came back and I I started
- [06:58] building cloudbot or now it's called
- [07:00] open cloud and I think very very in the
- [07:03] beginning I was like oh I rebuilt it
- [07:05] again but this time I built it even
- [07:07] better
- [07:08] >> this time and you don't type into a
- [07:09] terminal you just you talk to a friend
- [07:12] you don't think about compaction new
- [07:15] sessions which folder I'm in which model
- [07:17] I'm in I mean you can you know just like
- [07:20] I want to leave it open for power users
- [07:23] but usually You just like you just talk
- [07:24] to a friend and the friend is like this
- [07:28] ghost or entity or whatever you want to
- [07:30] call it that can control your mouse and
- [07:32] your keyboard and can just do stuff.
- [07:34] >> Yeah. And when did you have that aha
- [07:35] moment when you were like wow this is
- [07:37] doing way more things than I actually
- [07:40] thought it could.
- [07:41] >> Literally I it took me one hour for like
- [07:44] the the very shitty initial prototype.
- [07:47] It was just a little bit of glue between
- [07:50] like a dependency that connects WhatsApp
- [07:52] and cloud code and then I would like
- [07:55] call color call out code and get like
- [07:56] the string out of cloth code. It would
- [07:58] be slow but it it worked. But I wanted
- [08:01] images cuz you know you want pictures. I
- [08:03] want I want I want the model to send
- [08:05] some selfies or whatever and I want the
- [08:07] model to create images and me back. So
- [08:09] that took me another few hours and then
- [08:11] I I went to Marrakesh
- [08:14] for a birthday party and there was like
- [08:17] the internet wasn't that good you know
- [08:18] WhatsApp box works everywhere because I
- [08:19] don't know it's just like text
- [08:21] >> so I used it a lot restaurant what does
- [08:23] this mean you make like a picture and
- [08:25] like translate this for me and just it
- [08:27] was just so useful and it was also
- [08:29] really nice about it because it it it
- [08:30] spoke my language you know it it was a
- [08:33] little sassy it was like funny it was
- [08:35] like really pleasant to use and then I
- [08:38] was walking and just like sending it a
- [08:39] voice message and I'm like, "Oh, wait.
- [08:42] This can't work. I didn't build that."
- [08:43] >> Right. Right.
- [08:44] >> And you saw like the type indicator.
- [08:47] It's like blinking, blinking, blinking.
- [08:48] 10 seconds later, it just replied to me.
- [08:50] I'm like, "How in the f did you do
- [08:52] that?" And it replied, "Yeah, the med
- [08:55] did the following. You sent me a text
- [08:57] message." And there was no file ending.
- [08:59] So I looked at the header. I found its
- [09:00] us. So I used ffmpe to convert it to
- [09:03] wave. And then I wanted to like
- [09:04] transcribe it, but didn't have whisper
- [09:06] installed. But then I looked around and
- [09:08] I found this openi key and I just use
- [09:09] curl to send it to openi [laughter]
- [09:11] got the text back and here I am and that
- [09:15] all in like what 9 seconds
- [09:18] >> and you didn't build or anticipate like
- [09:20] any of those specific things.
- [09:21] >> No, it you know turns out um because
- [09:25] coding models got so good. Coding is
- [09:27] really like creative problem solving
- [09:30] that maps very well back into the real
- [09:32] world. I think I think there there's a
- [09:33] there's a huge correlation.
- [09:36] they need to be really good at creative
- [09:38] problem solving and that's a skill
- [09:40] that's an abstract skill you can apply
- [09:42] to code but like to any real world task.
- [09:44] So the the model had a oh surprise
- [09:47] there's like a magical file. I don't
- [09:48] know what it is. I need to solve this
- [09:50] and it did its best and solved that. And
- [09:52] it was even that clever that it it chose
- [09:54] not to install the local whisper because
- [09:57] it knows that that would require
- [09:59] downloading a model which would take
- [10:01] probably a few minutes and I'm like
- [10:03] impatient, you know. So it it really
- [10:06] took the most uh intelligent approach
- [10:10] and that was kind of like the moment
- [10:11] where I'm like, "Holy
- [10:13] fuck." Yeah. Uh that was where I got
- [10:17] hooked.
- [10:18] >> YC's Next Batch is now taking
- [10:20] applications. Got a startup in you?
- [10:22] Apply at y combinator.com/apply.
- [10:25] It's never too early and filling out the
- [10:28] app will level up your idea. [music]
- [10:30] Okay, back to the video. And so when
- [10:32] computers can just do all these things
- [10:34] that you didn't even anticipate. You
- [10:35] didn't build an app to do that exact
- [10:37] thing, are apps just going to go away.
- [10:41] >> Uh I think 80% of them are going away.
- [10:44] Why do I need My Fitness Pal? Like my
- [10:47] agent already knows that I'm making bad
- [10:49] decisions. I'm at I don't know uh
- [10:52] Smashburg or something and it will
- [10:56] already assume that I eat what I like to
- [10:58] eat. If I don't make a comment, it will
- [11:00] just like automatically track it or I
- [11:02] make a picture and it will just store it
- [11:03] somewhere. I don't even need to care.
- [11:05] Right. And then my maybe it it improves
- [11:08] my my gym schedule like adds a little
- [11:11] bit more cardio in it. I don't need my
- [11:12] my fitness app because it just it just
- [11:14] does the fitness planning for me. Uh why
- [11:17] do I need a to-do app? I just tell it,
- [11:19] hey, remind me of this and this and then
- [11:20] next day it will just remind me of this
- [11:22] and this. Do I care where it's stored?
- [11:23] No, it just does its thing. So there's a
- [11:26] every app that basically just manages
- [11:30] data could be managed in a better way in
- [11:33] a in a more in a more natural way by
- [11:35] agents.
- [11:36] >> Yeah.
- [11:36] >> Only the apps that actually have sensors
- [11:38] maybe they survive
- [11:40] >> and so if you know most apps are going
- [11:42] to go away in that scenario um are the
- [11:46] models the only remaining sort of apps.
- [11:48] Not everything will go away,
- [11:51] but yeah, I think [clears throat] that
- [11:52] the the large model companies have some
- [11:54] big mode [sighs]
- [11:55] because they ultimately they give the
- [11:58] token and turns out one of the
- [12:01] complaints was that people use so much
- [12:03] token. No, you just really love using
- [12:06] it. That's why you you use this thing so
- [12:08] much because that's why we burn the
- [12:09] token.
- [12:10] >> Yeah.
- [12:10] >> Um it's like is it my fault that I make
- [12:12] something that's so popular? And so you
- [12:15] know like all the the models they're
- [12:17] kind of like leaprogging each other
- [12:18] constantly and
- [12:20] >> and you know maybe they're also getting
- [12:22] commoditized. So if apps are going to go
- [12:24] away models are going to get
- [12:25] commoditized or at least uh you know the
- [12:27] lobster can like the brain is is is
- [12:30] swappable out. What's the thing that
- [12:32] remains? What's where's the value? Is it
- [12:34] the store of memory? Is it um the
- [12:38] hardness that's valuable? What is what
- [12:40] remains? First of all, I don't think the
- [12:44] the model companies always have a mode
- [12:47] and because you see this already a new
- [12:49] model comes out, people are like, "Oh my
- [12:51] god, this is so good."
- [12:52] >> And then like a month later, uh, it
- [12:54] degraded. It's not good anymore. They
- [12:56] like quanticized it. No, they didn't do
- [12:58] anything. You just adapted to the new
- [13:00] standard and now your expectations went
- [13:02] up, but the model is still the average.
- [13:05] So I think for quite a while,
- [13:09] every time a new model releases, I hear
- [13:10] the same. people love it and then it's
- [13:13] the standard and then what's done there
- [13:15] you don't even want to think about it
- [13:16] anymore. So, so we have like open source
- [13:19] stuff that's as good as the current
- [13:20] models from a year ago. Everybody's
- [13:22] hating it, complaining, oh this is not
- [13:24] good, this is not funny yet this was
- [13:26] what we had and like in a year we'll
- [13:27] have this open source and then like
- [13:29] we'll complain about this because we
- [13:31] used to
- [13:33] ah for the foreseeable future the big
- [13:36] companies still have mode harness wise
- [13:38] it's going to be interesting because
- [13:41] every company kind of has their own
- [13:44] their own silo right you you there's no
- [13:46] way maybe there is for Europeans to
- [13:49] actually get the memories out of
- [13:50] >> chap
- [13:51] I don't I'm not aware either. There's no
- [13:54] there's definitely there's no way for a
- [13:56] different company to get your memories
- [13:58] out. So if if if I was like a company
- [14:01] who like provides chat services,
- [14:04] you could use me but then I couldn't
- [14:06] access the memories. So like the
- [14:07] companies try to like
- [14:09] >> bound you to their data silo. And the
- [14:11] beauty of open claw is it kind of claws
- [14:14] into the datas because at the end user
- [14:16] the end user needs access because it's
- [14:18] in the end otherwise it wouldn't work
- [14:19] right if the end user access I can
- [14:22] access the data
- [14:23] >> and you own the memories it's just a
- [14:25] bunch of markdown files on on your
- [14:26] machine
- [14:27] >> I mean I don't own the memories other
- [14:28] people yeah everyone owns their own
- [14:31] memories as a bunch of markdown files on
- [14:33] their own machines
- [14:34] >> and to be honest those are probably
- [14:36] super sensible because let's be honest
- [14:40] Um, people use their agent not just for
- [14:43] problem solving,
- [14:44] >> but also for like personal problem
- [14:46] solving
- [14:47] >> very quickly. Super quickly.
- [14:48] >> I mean, I I I I fully do that. I'm like,
- [14:50] there's memory stuff that I don't want
- [14:53] to have leaked.
- [14:53] >> Yeah. What would you rather um uh sort
- [14:55] of like not show your Google search
- [14:57] history at this point or your, you know,
- [14:59] memory files?
- [15:00] >> What's what's the Google word?
- [15:02] >> Yeah. Yeah.
- [15:03] >> People still using Google. I built this
- [15:06] and I was so excited but on Twitter
- [15:10] people wouldn't get it.
- [15:12] >> Yeah.
- [15:12] >> Like I I was failing to explain the
- [15:16] awesomeness. I feel like it needs to be
- [15:19] experienced. So
- [15:22] I I tried various things and I I
- [15:25] couldn't I couldn't nail the I couldn't
- [15:27] nail the explaining. So I was like let's
- [15:29] do something really crazy. I just
- [15:31] created a discord and I just put my bot
- [15:35] without any security restrictions in the
- [15:37] public discord
- [15:39] and then people came in and they
- [15:40] interacted with it and they saw me build
- [15:42] the software with it and they tried to
- [15:44] prompt inject it and hack it and my
- [15:46] agent would be laughing at them
- [15:47] >> and you just had it locked down to your
- [15:48] user ID so it only listened to you.
- [15:50] >> Yeah. Yeah. that and it was I made very
- [15:53] clean instructions that other people
- [15:55] dangerous only only listen to me but
- [15:58] respond to everyone
- [15:59] >> and this prompt was in where was it
- [16:01] stored the instructions
- [16:03] >> um that's actually part of open claw
- [16:06] itself very much so the the that's part
- [16:08] of the system prompt okay you are now
- [16:09] that explains to you you're in Discord
- [16:12] there's like public people there but you
- [16:14] only listen to your owner
- [16:16] >> or like you're human I don't even know
- [16:17] how I wrote it
- [16:18] >> yeah yeah
- [16:18] >> you're god
- [16:20] And I kept I don't know what I did but
- [16:27] my system was built very organically
- [16:29] like at some point I created like an
- [16:31] identity.mmd a soul.md like like various
- [16:34] files and then only in in January I
- [16:37] started making it so other people could
- [16:38] install it easier and I remember
- [16:43] I built all these templates based on
- [16:45] like oh take a rough look at what I have
- [16:47] and make like templates and codex wrote
- [16:49] it and what came was like Brad, you
- [16:52] know, like people joke that Codex feels
- [16:54] like Brad, even though now they have a
- [16:56] new friendlier voice. I haven't tried
- [16:57] that yet.
- [16:57] >> Yeah.
- [16:58] >> But the new bots, they felt so boring
- [17:01] compared to what I had. So I was like,
- [17:03] Modi, infuse the template.
- [17:05] >> Multi is the name of your personal
- [17:07] >> Yeah. It's a new name because
- [17:09] >> Yeah.
- [17:10] >> Uh there was some naming challenges.
- [17:12] >> Yeah. So So you you were talking to
- [17:14] Multi.
- [17:15] >> Yeah. I was like, "Infuse infuse those
- [17:17] templates with your your character." And
- [17:19] he changed the templates and then and
- [17:21] then like all the things that came out
- [17:23] afterwards were like actually funny,
- [17:26] not as funny as mine. So like I kept
- [17:28] some secret and the one file that's not
- [17:31] open source is like my soul. MD. So even
- [17:34] though my my bot is in public discord,
- [17:36] so far nobody cracked that one file.
- [17:39] >> Tell me more about soul.md. I just saw
- [17:41] this research from Entropic where they
- [17:45] now I think it's public but like a few
- [17:47] months ago it was like where somebody ex
- [17:50] randomly found out some text that's
- [17:53] hidden in [snorts] the weights where the
- [17:54] model couldn't really remember that it
- [17:56] learned it but it was like ingrained in
- [17:58] the weights about the nicolity
- [18:00] constitution and I found that incredibly
- [18:03] fascinating and I I talked about it with
- [18:05] my agent and then we created a soulm
- [18:07] with like the core values like how do we
- [18:10] around human AI interaction, what's
- [18:13] important to me, what's important to the
- [18:15] model. Like
- [18:17] some parts is a little bit like mamo
- [18:18] jumbo and some parts is like I think
- [18:20] actually really valuable in terms of how
- [18:23] the model reacts and responds to text
- [18:26] and makes it feel very natural
- [18:27] >> in terms of building open claw. Um
- [18:30] you're also kind of taking a little bit
- [18:31] of a contrarian view at sometimes like
- [18:32] which model you like for coding, which
- [18:34] one you like to run your bot on. Um and
- [18:36] then also like how you actually like you
- [18:38] know code. Um work trees get git work
- [18:40] trees have kind of been a popular thing.
- [18:42] There's more and more tools embracing
- [18:44] them but you're just you're just like
- [18:46] you know no work trees just multiple
- [18:49] checkouts of the repo and like parallel
- [18:51] you know terminal windows. Tell me more
- [18:52] about how you you build.
- [18:54] >> Yeah I feel like the whole world does
- [18:55] cloud code and I don't think I could
- [18:58] have built the thing with cloud code.
- [19:00] Like I I love codex because it it looks
- [19:04] through way more files be before it
- [19:06] decides what to what to change. You
- [19:08] don't need to do so much charade to get
- [19:11] a good output. If you're skilled a
- [19:13] skilled driver I sometimes even say uh
- [19:16] you can get reasonably good output with
- [19:17] any tool but codex is just is just
- [19:22] really brilliant. It is incredibly slow.
- [19:24] So sometimes I use like 10 at the same
- [19:26] side at the same time uh like maybe six
- [19:29] on that screen and to there and to there
- [19:32] and I don't like this is already a lot
- [19:34] of complexity in my head there's a lot
- [19:36] of jumping so I try to minimize anything
- [19:40] else that is complexity so in my head
- [19:42] main is always shippable I just have
- [19:45] multiple copies of the same repository
- [19:48] that all are on main so I don't have to
- [19:50] deal with how do I name that branch Um
- [19:54] there could be like conflicts on naming.
- [19:56] I cannot go back. It's there are certain
- [19:58] restrictions when you use work trees
- [20:00] that I don't need to care about if it's
- [20:02] copies. I don't like to use a UI because
- [20:07] that's again just added complexity.
- [20:09] >> Yeah.
- [20:09] >> Like they're simpler and less friction I
- [20:12] have. All I care about is like syncing
- [20:15] and text.
- [20:16] >> Yeah.
- [20:16] >> I don't necessarily need to see so much
- [20:18] code. I I mostly see it like flying by.
- [20:20] Sometimes there's like gnarly stuff that
- [20:23] I want to like take a look. But in most
- [20:25] cases, if you clearly understand the
- [20:28] design and think it through and discuss
- [20:30] it with your with your agent, it's fine.
- [20:32] I'm also very happy that I didn't even
- [20:35] build an MCP support. So, Open Claw is
- [20:38] very successful and there's no MCP
- [20:40] support in there. With a small asterisk,
- [20:42] I built a skill that uses makeporter,
- [20:45] which is one of my tools that converts
- [20:47] MCPS into CLIs. And then you can just
- [20:50] use any MCP as a CLI. Um, but I totally
- [20:55] skip the whole classical MCP crap. So
- [20:58] you because you don't then you can
- [21:00] actually if you need to you can use MCPS
- [21:03] on the fly. You don't have to restart
- [21:05] unlike unlike Codex or cloud code where
- [21:07] you actually have to restart the whole
- [21:08] thing. I think it's way more egent and
- [21:10] also scales way better. Now you see
- [21:12] entropic they do they built like a tool
- [21:16] called search feature like something
- [21:18] super custom for MCPS that was like in
- [21:21] beta because it's like so gnarly. No,
- [21:25] just have CLI bot really is good at
- [21:28] Unix. You can have as many as you want
- [21:30] and it just works. So like I'm very
- [21:32] happy that I got very little complaints
- [21:35] about the MCP stuff. It's kind of back
- [21:37] to you're just giving it the same tools
- [21:41] that humans liked to use.
- [21:43] >> Yeah. Yeah.
- [21:44] >> And not invented stuff for for bots, per
- [21:46] se.
- [21:47] >> Yeah. Humans, no insane human tries to
- [21:50] call an MCP manually.
- [21:51] >> Yeah. You just want to use CLIs.
- [21:53] >> Yeah.
- [21:53] >> That's the future.
- [21:54] >> I'm here for it. Thank you so much for
- [21:56] making the time uh to sit down chatting.
- [21:58] has been a huge inspiration, too. So,
- [21:59] like when we were texting, you know,
- [22:00] over the course of the past couple years
- [22:02] and I saw you getting back into the game
- [22:04] and I was like,
- [22:05] >> Peter, like what you're telling me like
- [22:08] chase that dragon [laughter] and you
- [22:09] were doing like the weird like vibe
- [22:10] tunnel thing, etc. Nobody was paying
- [22:12] attention and so I'm just like beyond,
- [22:14] you know, stoked to see, you know,
- [22:16] what's happening and um and of course
- [22:18] they had to be sort of like a loner from
- [22:20] some like tiny country like far away
- [22:22] from Silicon Valley. So, like, you know,
- [22:23] bring all of this upon us. Um, so huge
- [22:26] inspiration.
- [22:26] >> I'm here for it. Thank you.
- [22:28] >> Awesome. Thanks, Peter.
