## Key insight / summary

- **AI 시대 성장 전략의 근본적 변화**: 기존 성장 전략의 70%가 무효화됨. 최적화보다 혁신에 95% 투자해야 하며, 점진적 개선이 아닌 솔루션의 재발명이 필요 (Lovable 성장 책임자가 15-20년 경험 대비 30-40%만 유효하다고 언급)

- **진입 장벽 완전 제거 전략**: 제품을 아낌없이 무료로 제공하는 것이 핵심 성장 비밀. 사용자가 마케팅을 대신해주려 할 때 절대 막지 말고 오히려 적극 지원 ("해커톤 하고 싶다면 크레딧을 얼마나 줄까?" 접근법)

- **Building in Public + 소셜 증폭**: 창립자와 직원들의 소셜 미디어 활동과 결합된 공개 개발이 가장 효과적인 성장 동력

- **경험의 압도적 차별화**: 입소문 루프 생성의 유일한 방법은 사용자를 완전히 놀라게 하는 것 ("blow their socks off"). 단순 만족이 아닌 충격적 경험 제공 필요

- **지속적 제품-시장 적합성 재확보**: AI 시대에는 PMF가 3개월마다 재평가되어야 하는 개념으로 변화. 기술 발전 속도로 인해 가능한 것이 월단위로 변함

- **창작의 민주화 현상**: 비기술자도 완전한 소프트웨어를 처음부터 구축 가능해짐. 8백만 사용자가 Lovable을 시도했고, 다양한 개인적/업무적 용도로 활용 (프로포즈 앱, 튜터링 앱, 내부 도구 등)

- **능력-가치-확장의 3단계 프레임워크**: 소프트웨어 도입은 "무엇이 가능한가(capability) → 어떤 가치를 얻는가(value) → 어떻게 확장하는가(scaling)" 순서로 진행되며, 현재 AI 코딩은 능력 탐색 단계

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **무료 크레딧 대량 지급 전략 도입**: Proby도 진입 장벽을 완전히 제거해야 함. 기업이 내부 해커톤이나 파일럿 프로젝트로 Proby 사용하겠다고 하면 즉시 무료 크레딧을 제공하는 정책 수립 → 전략문서의 "90일 검증 스프린트"를 무료 크레딧으로 가속화

- **창립자 소셜 미디어 전략 강화**: Building in Public 접근법으로 Proby 개발 과정, 고객 성공 사례, AI 리서치 혁신 스토리를 창립자와 팀원들이 적극적으로 소셜에서 공유 → 현재 전략문서에 없는 브랜드 인지도 확산 채널 확보

- **"충격적 첫 경험" 설계 필수**: 사용자가 Proby를 처음 사용했을 때 "이게 정말 가능해?"라는 반응이 나올 정도의 압도적 데모 경험 구축 → 전략문서의 "AI 조정 품질이 인간과 동등하다"는 가정을 넘어 인간보다 명확히 우수한 영역 발굴

- **3개월 주기 PMF 재검증 시스템 구축**: AI 기술 발전에 따른 Proby 역량 변화를 분기별로 고객에게 재소개하는 체계적 프로세스 필요 → 전략문서의 고객 세그먼트별 니즈 변화를 지속 추적하는 메커니즘

- **창작 도구로서의 포지셔닝 강화**: "AI 아바타 조사관" 개념을 되살려 비전문가도 전문적 리서치를 "창작"할 수 있다는 관점으로 재포지셔닝 → 전략문서의 스타트업 PM/PD 세그먼트를 "창업가" 세그먼트로 확장

- **개인 용도 사용 사례 적극 발굴**: 업무용뿐만 아니라 개인 프로젝트, 사이드 비즈니스, 학술 연구 등 다양한 개인 용도 장려 → 전략문서의 TAM 계산에 B2C 시장도 포함 고려

- **능력 시연 중심의 초기 GTM**: 현재 가치 중심 마케팅에서 "이런 것도 가능하다" 식의 능력 시연 중심으로 전환 → 전략문서의 파일럿 전략을 경이로운 데모 경험 중심으로 재설계

- **월간 신기능 출시 및 재소개 사이클**: Lovable처럼 매월 새로운 가능성을 보여주는 기능 출시 후 기존 고객들에게 "이제 이런 것도 할 수 있다" 재마케팅 → 전략문서의 고객 성공 전략에 지속적 재인게이지먼트 추가

- [00:00] You're ahead of growth at Lovable on
- [00:01] track to be the fastest or one of the
- [00:04] fastest growing companies in history.
- [00:06] >> We're over 200 million in AR at this
- [00:08] point. We're 100 people large. The pace
- [00:10] here is insane.
- [00:11] >> You said that you've had to throw out
- [00:13] most of your growth playbook.
- [00:14] >> I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've
- [00:17] learned in the last 15 to 20 years of
- [00:19] being in growth transfers here because
- [00:21] we just need to invest in such bigger
- [00:23] bets and innovate and create new growth
- [00:25] loops here. Everybody and their mother
- [00:27] is starting a vibe coding business
- [00:29] nowadays and we need to figure out how
- [00:31] to be ahead of them. And to be ahead of
- [00:33] them is not optimization of the problem.
- [00:35] It's reinvention of the solution. I just
- [00:37] feel like I usually spend maybe 5%
- [00:40] innovating on growth in my previous
- [00:42] roles. Right now I'm spending 95%
- [00:45] innovating on growth and only 5% on
- [00:47] optimization.
- [00:48] >> What do you find is actually moving the
- [00:50] needle? One of our biggest strategy is
- [00:52] building in public and it's coupled with
- [00:55] employee socials, founder le socials and
- [00:57] another one is giving your product away
- [00:59] a lot. This is part of our growth secret
- [01:02] sauce. You have to remove the barrier of
- [01:05] entry. If somebody one of our users
- [01:06] stands up and say hey I'm going to have
- [01:09] a hackathon at my work unlovable. Can
- [01:11] you give us some free credits to play
- [01:14] with? Why would we prevent a person who
- [01:16] wants to do all of the marketing and
- [01:18] activating for us from using us? We're
- [01:21] like, take it. How much do you need?
- [01:22] >> The trick is get more people to try it.
- [01:24] Just ship things you can talk about.
- [01:25] >> The only way to create a word of mouth
- [01:27] loop is just to blow their socks off.
- [01:30] >> Today, my guest is Elena Vera, head of
- [01:33] growth at Lovable. In under one year
- [01:35] after launching with fewer than 100
- [01:37] people, Lovable hit 200 million ARR,
- [01:41] which is one of, if not the fastest ramp
- [01:44] to 200 million AR R in history, and
- [01:46] growth is still accelerating. They've
- [01:48] also recently raised a series B at a $6
- [01:51] billion valuation. So, with that,
- [01:53] there's a lot to learn about what
- [01:55] Lovable has figured out about growth.
- [01:57] This is Elena's fourth visit to the
- [01:59] podcast, A Record. She is my favorite
- [02:01] growth mind. And in our conversation, we
- [02:04] talk about how the growth playbook has
- [02:06] fundamentally changed for AI companies.
- [02:08] What works now, what no longer works,
- [02:10] and what has surprised her most about
- [02:12] how Lovable grows. She also shares her
- [02:14] advice about whether working at an AI
- [02:16] company is right for you, some
- [02:18] incredibly interesting insights into
- [02:20] lovable secret sauce for growth, the
- [02:22] unique ways they operate internally,
- [02:24] their approach to building minimal
- [02:25] lovable products, also how they hire,
- [02:28] and also how product market fit as a
- [02:30] concept is no longer what it used to be,
- [02:32] and how every company basically has to
- [02:34] recapture product market fit every 3
- [02:36] months. This episode is incredibly
- [02:38] tactical, and you will leave this
- [02:39] conversation smarter on so many levels.

- [05:19] Elena, thank you so much for being here
- [05:22] and welcome back to the podcast.
- [05:24] >> Thank you for having me. As you know,
- [05:27] this is uh a record fourth time back to
- [05:30] the podcast. No one else has ever
- [05:32] achieved this feat. I feel like you're
- [05:34] uh you're basically my co-host now.
- [05:35] >> I love it. Thank you for inviting me
- [05:37] back. I'm very proud record holder in
- [05:40] this regard.
- [05:41] >> What I love about you coming back each
- [05:42] time is feels like every time you come
- [05:43] back, you're just doing something even
- [05:45] more epic and exciting. And so these
- [05:47] days, as we'll hear in the intro, you're
- [05:48] head of growth at Lovable, which no big
- [05:51] deal, on track to be uh the fastest or
- [05:54] one of the fastest growing companies in
- [05:56] history, uh depending on the metric that
- [05:58] you track. Let's talk about just the
- [06:00] scale and growth of Lovable to give
- [06:01] people a sense of just how incredible
- [06:02] this is. I'll share a bit of this in the
- [06:04] intro, but just like what are some stats
- [06:05] you can share about just how things are
- [06:07] going at Loveable?
- [06:08] >> So, uh we are just a little bit over one
- [06:10] years old since we launched. Uh the
- [06:12] company actually did exist as a GPT
- [06:15] engineer before, but it officially
- [06:17] launched in the third week of November
- [06:19] last year in 2024.
- [06:21] So uh for us, we've hit over $200
- [06:25] million in annual recurring revenue
- [06:27] before we even hit our one-year uh
- [06:30] milestone since being launched, which is
- [06:32] pretty incredible. Uleni actually have a
- [06:34] really great um blog post on how quickly
- [06:38] it takes for companies usually to get to
- [06:39] their first million AR and it's usually
- [06:42] multiple years. So this is definitely a
- [06:45] unicorn. I don't think this is a
- [06:47] standard. There's couple of things that
- [06:50] um account for it and we can talk about
- [06:52] it and the growth is only accelerating.
- [06:54] So it's compounding which is great
- [06:55] because we had our 100 million in end of
- [06:58] July and just four months later we were
- [07:01] at 200 million. So 7 months to well
- [07:04] maybe 8 months to 100 million another 4
- [07:07] months to get to 200 million. And from
- [07:10] uh users too we already have over 8
- [07:12] million users um that have tried
- [07:14] lovable. We have as you can imagine to
- [07:16] feed that 200 million hundreds of
- [07:18] thousands of paid subscribers as well
- [07:21] that are paying for us. Uh so things are
- [07:24] things are going great and we'll talk
- [07:26] about why.
- [07:27] >> Okay. Absurd. I think people are getting
- [07:29] used to these insane numbers and not
- [07:31] long ago is like okay if you hit a
- [07:33] million ARR in a year you're doing
- [07:35] pretty well.
- [07:36] >> Yeah. Yeah. I think it's still you're
- [07:38] doing pretty well if you have a million
- [07:40] AR in one year. This is uh this is one
- [07:44] of the once in a lifetime type of
- [07:46] companies and the category the way that
- [07:48] it's evolving. So I want to make sure
- [07:50] that people don't also set this as a
- [07:52] benchmark for success because it should
- [07:54] never be and in some categories it might
- [07:57] be even faster um as we continue
- [07:59] evolving technology but I don't think
- [08:02] that it's realistic to expect it um out
- [08:05] of your business that you're starting
- [08:07] right now.
- [08:08] >> That is such an important point you're
- [08:09] making there. It's so discouraging to
- [08:12] founders to hear this these stories of
- [08:14] getting 200 million not and again this
- [08:16] is ARR. There's a lot of companies,
- [08:19] especially in the data labeling space,
- [08:20] I've had them all on the podcast that
- [08:22] are uh very fast growing, but they're
- [08:24] not recurring revenue. There's also they
- [08:26] pay out their people to do this data
- [08:28] labeling. So, the revenue numbers there
- [08:30] don't really equate like recurring $200
- [08:33] million a year is absurd.
- [08:36] >> Yeah, it is. It is absurd. I really want
- [08:39] to make sure that people understand as
- [08:41] we go through this episode as to why
- [08:43] it's happening because part of it is
- [08:45] unlovable, part of it is just in the
- [08:46] market and and how it's moving. So when
- [08:49] you're setting yourself as a benchmark
- [08:51] uh so you know which benchmarks you
- [08:52] actually to use and whether lovable is
- [08:54] the benchmark that you should be using.
- [08:56] >> Cool. I'm going to get into that next.
- [08:57] Last question just I want to see what
- [08:59] you can share here. A lot of people look
- [09:01] at these numbers. A lot of people are
- [09:03] very skeptical. These are lasting
- [09:05] durable numbers. Like who are these
- [09:07] people? How is there $200 million being
- [09:09] spent on lovable? Anything you can amp
- [09:12] just like give people confidence. This
- [09:13] is real. This is going to last. This is
- [09:16] a really durable business.
- [09:18] >> Well, I saw Stripe receipts. So, it is
- [09:21] real as far as I'm concerned. Um, unless
- [09:23] Stripe dashboard is lying to us, but it
- [09:25] is money getting deposited in our bank
- [09:27] account. But, uh, let's talk about who's
- [09:30] actually contributing to that number. We
- [09:32] do have a really large use case of
- [09:34] people uh, starting their own companies
- [09:36] on lovable. So we call it a founder use
- [09:38] case where somebody that is nontechnical
- [09:40] that has never been able to code or
- [09:42] create a piece of software is now able
- [09:44] to come in and actually build an app
- [09:46] completely from scratch and uh some of
- [09:48] them are already monetizing it some of
- [09:50] it just using it for lead genen for
- [09:52] other services or uh some physical goods
- [09:55] for example that they're uh that they're
- [09:56] selling. Some of them are just still
- [09:58] building and uh we monetize on the act
- [10:01] of building. So that progression of like
- [10:03] building up to your product market fit
- [10:05] takes quite a bit of time. And even with
- [10:07] lovable, we're so much more efficient
- [10:09] and effective compared to hiring an
- [10:12] engineer uh in terms of the price. But
- [10:15] um it still takes time. Uh so we have a
- [10:17] lot of founders uh whether it's B2C, whe
- [10:20] there's B2B, so consumer products,
- [10:22] business products, e-commerce, um
- [10:24] whatever it is. But on the other side,
- [10:25] we have a lot of employees within
- [10:27] companies using lovable as well. Uh
- [10:29] where they're building internal tools or
- [10:31] they're building prototypes, they're
- [10:33] building landing pages. So uh that is
- [10:36] another use case that is very relevant
- [10:38] and quite uh efficient for us. But then
- [10:41] there is a hype and discovery that is
- [10:43] happening as well because uh when I
- [10:46] think about software I think about it. I
- [10:48] talked to John Cuddler actually and he
- [10:50] gave me this framework that is like
- [10:52] completely stuck in my mind of software
- [10:54] always goes through capabilities stage
- [10:56] first like what is possible uh to
- [10:59] actually create with this then it needs
- [11:01] to transition into value of how is it
- [11:03] that am I going to get value out of this
- [11:04] and then you can start thinking about
- [11:06] scaling it uh of which aspects of my
- [11:08] life and my work uh can this actually go
- [11:11] in and we're right now very much in the
- [11:13] capability stage with vibe coding
- [11:14] because everybody's just exploring what
- [11:16] can I do and And the beautiful thing
- [11:18] here is that what you can do changes
- [11:21] every month to three months. So, uh you
- [11:23] constantly need to come back and you
- [11:25] need to see what has changed. So, a lot
- [11:26] of people use it for personal reasons.
- [11:29] Um they I build myself uh apps, tutoring
- [11:32] apps for my kid. So, he has to answer
- [11:35] questions in order to get some screen
- [11:36] time accumulated for him. I build my own
- [11:39] portfolio. I see people doing wonderful
- [11:42] things. My favorite story that I always
- [11:44] say, uh there's this um man that created
- [11:47] a proposal on lovable. So his fiance had
- [11:50] to answer questions and like she had to
- [11:52] complete this game and then at the end
- [11:54] there was like this big reveal and he
- [11:55] proposed to her. But people just unlock
- [11:58] the most creative things that they build
- [12:00] on lovable and that's where the revenue
- [12:02] is coming from. the one piece that is
- [12:04] working very well for us in terms of how
- [12:06] our monetization model is set up and how
- [12:08] it interjects with your activation
- [12:10] moment which we can also cover but that
- [12:13] is what's driving um that um both
- [12:15] conversion and retention rates.
- [12:17] >> Let me ask you one question that's on
- [12:18] people's minds I imagine as you talk
- [12:20] about this just what is what is
- [12:21] retention look like? Yeah. So retention
- [12:24] uh really I look at it in two ways. Uh
- [12:26] retention that it comes as a subscriber
- [12:28] retention. Uh so how much pay
- [12:31] subscribers do we get and how many of
- [12:33] them are we capable of renewing. There's
- [12:35] also very important aspect of it is how
- [12:36] many of them can we expand because if
- [12:38] you can get positive or above 100% net
- [12:41] dollar retention which is super
- [12:42] important metric for investors. If you
- [12:44] don't know about net dollar retention
- [12:46] please read it up. That's like a
- [12:47] superpower to get bigger multiple. if
- [12:49] you can show um NDR that is over 100 and
- [12:52] then there's actually engagement
- [12:53] retention as well because uh that is the
- [12:55] leading indicator for how your paid
- [12:58] retention is going to look like for paid
- [13:00] retention um I know there's a so much on
- [13:03] the market of oh this is a high product
- [13:06] and um it just it's a leaky bucket and
- [13:08] it has really high churn rates although
- [13:11] um I'm not I shouldn't share it's not
- [13:13] public numbers for us to share actual
- [13:15] retention however what I can say it's on
- [13:17] par with benchmarks of other B2B SAS
- [13:20] products that I've ever worked at and I
- [13:22] worked with Miro, Dropbox, uh Survey
- [13:24] Monkey, Netifi, um Amplitude and others.
- [13:28] So, are we are we absolutely crushing
- [13:31] with paid retention? Um no, are we where
- [13:34] most of the other companies are? Yes.
- [13:37] Our NDR is quite good because when
- [13:39] people build, they want to buy more
- [13:40] credits to bill. So, uh, we're seeing
- [13:42] really good, uh, revenue retention, but
- [13:44] we're honestly more focused right now on
- [13:46] engagement retention than even paid
- [13:48] retention because our northstar is just
- [13:51] to get as much usage as possible. And,
- [13:54] uh, we will fix and tune our
- [13:55] monetization model afterwards. So,
- [13:58] engagement retention, I would say, is a
- [14:00] by far bigger priority focus for us at
- [14:03] the moment.
- [14:04] >> That is incredibly uh, interesting and
- [14:06] optimistic to hear because of the growth
- [14:08] rate. Uh rarely is growth rate this high
- [14:11] and retention is on par with great
- [14:14] companies.
- [14:15] >> Yeah. And I'll just say too which is a
- [14:17] little bit maybe counterintuitive to
- [14:19] would be to a lot of companies we don't
- [14:22] optimize for revenue at all. In fact
- [14:24] internally we have a lot of discussions
- [14:26] about how can we give more products
- [14:29] away. How can we uh reduce our revenue
- [14:32] growth rate by just getting more paid
- [14:35] subscribers, more users using lovable to
- [14:37] just get bigger share of the market. So
- [14:40] our revenue is an outcome of us just
- [14:43] trying to get more people through the
- [14:45] door, not us trying to optimize for
- [14:48] revenue per user or to get them to
- [14:50] monetize at the higher rate. So there's
- [14:52] like a very interesting path here where
- [14:54] by actually focusing on the inputs like
- [14:56] you should, it translates to a good
- [14:58] output. But we don't look at that output
- [15:00] as something that we're trying to grow.
- [15:02] >> Let's talk about growth. Let's talk
- [15:04] about what you've learned about growth
- [15:05] in this space. You had this post online
- [15:08] where you said that you've had to throw
- [15:09] out most of your growth playbook.
- [15:11] >> This is a huge deal. You've led growth a
- [15:13] lot of really successful companies.
- [15:15] >> Lovable is growing incredibly well. Uh
- [15:17] this tells me there's a lot we can learn
- [15:19] from what you've seen. So tell us what
- [15:22] you're seeing, what's still working,
- [15:23] what's not working, what you've uh
- [15:25] learned about what it takes to drive
- [15:26] growth at a company like Lovable. Yeah,
- [15:28] I would say that in any other role that
- [15:30] I've come into before, uh I felt
- [15:34] confident in about 80% of the patterns
- [15:37] that I can bring to that role. Meaning
- [15:39] that I can identify inputs, understand
- [15:41] which framework kind of applies. I know
- [15:44] a bunch of examples that fit in within
- [15:46] that framework. So we just need to
- [15:47] localize a solution and push and it was
- [15:49] quite productive in terms of getting a
- [15:51] company those additional acquisition,
- [15:54] conversion, engagement, monetization
- [15:56] rates. So um I I felt very repetitive in
- [16:00] a way um after some time because I feel
- [16:02] like I'm just coming in and copy pasting
- [16:04] copy pasting and although every single
- [16:05] company loves to say that they have
- [16:07] unique problems at the end of the day
- [16:08] all of the problems were very similar
- [16:10] and I felt like I was like doing the
- [16:12] same job over and over again when I
- [16:14] started at lovable the one thing to me
- [16:15] that was very clear is that uh this
- [16:18] company was growing like crazy before I
- [16:21] joined. So I want to make sure that
- [16:23] there's not that much value on what I
- [16:25] have even added to date because this
- [16:27] company is on a tear and yes we're
- [16:30] rounding the edges to and removing
- [16:32] barriers for growth. Uh so we're not
- [16:35] standing in our own way but uh there's
- [16:37] something more magical happening here
- [16:39] that is not a pattern that I've ever
- [16:42] seen before. It's not a framework that I
- [16:44] can even conceptualize um in my head.
- [16:47] And plus, it's a new category that I've
- [16:49] never seen or I've never been in a
- [16:52] company that is in a new emerging
- [16:54] category that hits fastmoving waters so
- [16:57] quickly. And that's the difference
- [16:59] because when you're usually trying to
- [17:01] create a new category, it takes years. I
- [17:03] know it's every marketer's dream to
- [17:05] create a new category, but it takes
- [17:07] decades often to like really to really
- [17:09] get that much hype and adoption around
- [17:11] it. Versus with Vibe coding, this has
- [17:14] seemed to have happened really quickly.
- [17:16] It's like it's hit the nerve with the
- [17:17] market. So yes, we're at the right
- [17:20] place, we're at the right time, but
- [17:21] we're also in really fastm moving waters
- [17:24] and um the demand that is coming to us
- [17:26] like we need to capture it mostly. We
- [17:28] don't need to generate a lot of it yet.
- [17:31] But at the same time, it comes with a
- [17:32] really big downfalls of we're not in
- [17:34] control of a lot of our growth. I mean,
- [17:36] let's be honest about it. There's so
- [17:38] much incredible word of mouth that is
- [17:40] happening and we're trying to grow that
- [17:42] but uh to enable as much of that as
- [17:44] possible but um it's the company is
- [17:47] moving. We're just like hanging on to it
- [17:50] as fast as possible and making sure that
- [17:53] the we're like not going to hit a wall
- [17:55] so to speak in front of us and that the
- [17:58] wheels are greased and that all of the
- [18:00] pieces are in place. like your race car
- [18:02] framework uh that you have as well that
- [18:04] like we're we're really just putting a
- [18:06] lot of oil into it and um figuring out
- [18:09] what is our engine actually going to be
- [18:11] that is going to take us forward. But uh
- [18:14] when I'm thinking about the patterns
- [18:16] here and what I have to unlearn, I feel
- [18:18] like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned
- [18:21] in the last 15 to 20 years of being in
- [18:23] growth transfers here. And uh some of it
- [18:26] is very straightforward. Okay, this is
- [18:28] how you're going to do paid marketing.
- [18:30] this is how you're going to do some of
- [18:31] the habitual retention. Here's the free
- [18:33] to pay maybe monetization uh frameworks
- [18:36] that still stand. But the rest of it um
- [18:40] seriously doesn't feel like it even
- [18:41] matters anymore because we just need to
- [18:44] invest in such bigger bets and innovate
- [18:46] and create new growth loops here as
- [18:49] opposed to trying to optimize it uh to
- [18:51] the moon and be and beyond uh which
- [18:53] would I usually be focused on in a scale
- [18:56] business like this.
- [18:57] >> Let's follow those threads. So what is
- [18:58] it that no longer is worth it in this
- [19:00] bucket of just like let's not spend any
- [19:02] time on this thing and then what do you
- [19:04] find is actually moving the needle
- [19:06] >> not worth it in growth uh most of the
- [19:09] people spend most of the time optimizing
- [19:12] existing user journeys. So, uh, you
- [19:15] already have maybe some of your growth
- [19:17] loops that you understand that you try
- [19:18] to optimize or you just know, hey,
- [19:20] there's big drop offs from acquisition
- [19:22] to activation. Let me go figure out how
- [19:24] to I can tweak the dials to get it done.
- [19:27] Here, what I find is that um,
- [19:29] optimizations are just not worth our
- [19:31] time. So, a lot of the times my growth
- [19:34] team actually ends up working on new
- [19:35] features or just standing up new growth
- [19:37] loops one after another. And yes, there
- [19:40] is of of course the saying of like more
- [19:42] growth loops does not mean more growth.
- [19:45] But at the same time, the market is
- [19:47] moving so quickly. You need to stand up
- [19:50] a bunch of initiatives uh to capture it
- [19:52] because it's perishable or we also have
- [19:55] so much competition. We're not alone
- [19:57] here. So we can't ignore that there's
- [20:01] everybody in their mother is starting a
- [20:02] VIP coding business nowadays and we need
- [20:05] to figure out how to be ahead of them.
- [20:06] and to be ahead of them is not
- [20:08] optimization of the problem. It's
- [20:10] reinvention of the solution. So I just
- [20:13] feel like I usually spend maybe 5% maybe
- [20:16] 10% if I'm lucky innovating on growth in
- [20:19] my roles uh in my previous roles. Right
- [20:22] now I'm spending 95% innovating on
- [20:24] growth and only 5% on optimization. And
- [20:27] most of my frameworks are on
- [20:29] optimization because it's really hard to
- [20:31] come up with frameworks for innovation
- [20:33] because by default they're by definition
- [20:37] they're innovative.
- [20:38] >> What I'm hearing here is uh new features
- [20:40] launching new features, new products as
- [20:42] one of the bigger growth levers versus
- [20:44] like you have a bunch of cool stuff make
- [20:46] it more make it easier to use increase
- [20:48] activation reduce friction things like
- [20:50] that.
- [20:51] >> Yeah. And for example, um we on growth
- [20:54] team launched uh integration with
- [20:56] Shopify to enable e-commerce use case
- [20:59] because we're like hey there's already
- [21:01] people trying to come in and do it and
- [21:03] Shopify was open for integration with
- [21:05] us. Let's go lean into it so people can
- [21:08] vibe code their storefronts. Uh that
- [21:10] came out of growth that usually would
- [21:12] never come out of growth. like why would
- [21:13] growth team ever invest into a core
- [21:15] product integration or we um enable
- [21:18] voice mode for people so they can
- [21:20] actually chat with lovable using their
- [21:21] voice as opposed to only having type and
- [21:24] um that's also it's a feature it's a
- [21:26] core product feature but we're like hey
- [21:28] it's going to help people to converse
- [21:29] with lovable more it's going to increase
- [21:31] the engagement one area that we've spent
- [21:33] very little time in is activation
- [21:35] because usually I spend majority of my
- [21:37] time in activation because there's so
- [21:39] many awareness things that need to
- [21:42] happened and uh so many things that uh
- [21:45] we we need to like smooth out experience
- [21:48] for the users in order for them to get
- [21:50] through that setup moment to aha moment
- [21:52] to that habit loop and here you're just
- [21:54] interacting with agent. So uh we at the
- [21:57] beginning were like the agent team that
- [22:00] we have here is working a lot on it like
- [22:01] why would we go in there and and do
- [22:04] anything is like our core team is
- [22:05] responsible for activation. Now we're
- [22:07] starting to move into doing agent work
- [22:09] ourselves. So all of a sudden growth
- [22:11] team is not just doing product surfaces
- [22:14] now we're doing agentic workflows um and
- [22:17] codifying agent instructions in order
- [22:20] for customers to activate better. So the
- [22:22] work fundamentally I feel like has
- [22:24] gotten deeper into product and deeper
- [22:27] into actual core product functionality
- [22:30] as opposed to just being a smoothing
- [22:32] surface on the outer layers.
- [22:34] >> Okay, that is also a very big deal.
- [22:36] Every growth person that's ever been on
- [22:38] this podcast, including you, always
- [22:39] talks about the power of activation.
- [22:41] Just the how much opportunity there is
- [22:43] constant to get people to this aha
- [22:45] moment, realize how the value of this
- [22:47] product that increases retention,
- [22:48] increases everything. And what you're
- [22:50] saying here is you barely spend any time
- [22:52] on activation because in a company like
- [22:55] Lovable, there's a prompt. You give it
- [22:57] what you want, it generates a thing, and
- [22:59] that's basically all it is. And so the
- [23:01] impact is to make that agent better at
- [23:04] that thing versus microoptimize every
- [23:06] step.
- [23:06] >> And our agent team spends night and day
- [23:10] thinking about it. So I've never been at
- [23:12] the company where core team thinks so
- [23:14] much about activation, think so much
- [23:16] about that first generation, thinks so
- [23:18] much about reaching aha moment. So it's
- [23:21] more weaved in into DNA of the overall
- [23:23] company which takes the pressure off of
- [23:26] me to only have to focus on it because
- [23:28] otherwise yeah I would be in that in
- [23:30] that experience all the time but I feel
- [23:32] a lot more at ease because everybody's
- [23:34] thinking about it and everybody's
- [23:37] working on making agent better and agent
- [23:40] the beauty of it is it doesn't matter if
- [23:41] it's actually first generation or if
- [23:43] it's your nth generation it just needs
- [23:45] to be a better generation agent needs to
- [23:47] understand your intent better and think
- [23:49] and reason behind behind it. So it like
- [23:51] improves the entire life cycle
- [23:53] immediately as opposed to having to only
- [23:56] work on that first experience per se.
- [23:59] >> And what you're not saying is don't care
- [24:01] about that experience. It's the team
- [24:03] building that is already obsessed with
- [24:05] making that activation experience
- [24:07] better.
- [24:08] >> And I I love that because I that's the
- [24:10] core product functionality at this
- [24:12] point. And before uh people would spend
- [24:16] more time building deeper features or
- [24:18] deeper use cases or trying to um improve
- [24:22] some platform functionality and now the
- [24:24] core team they're obsessed about that
- [24:26] first experience because that is core
- [24:28] product.
- [24:29] >> Another lever that I've noticed
- [24:31] especially with lovable and I'm seeing
- [24:32] it more and more in social media is just
- [24:34] founders telling you what's going on. I
- [24:36] think this connects really deeply with
- [24:38] the new features. Launch new features.
- [24:39] Say Anton is just like hey check out
- [24:41] this cool new thing. Check out our
- [24:42] growth numbers. Is that a big growth
- [24:44] lever too?
- [24:45] >> Yeah. So, one of our biggest strategy is
- [24:49] uh building in public. Uh building in
- [24:52] public and it's coupled with employee
- [24:54] socials, founder socials for sure. Uh
- [24:58] this is difficult for larger companies,
- [25:00] but when you're smaller and you still
- [25:02] have a little bit more narrative control
- [25:05] uh with uh with everybody on your team,
- [25:07] plus you have so much more trust within
- [25:09] your organization of whether people are
- [25:11] going to say the right things because
- [25:12] they understand what actually has
- [25:14] happened. Uh that ability to just really
- [25:18] quickly deliver the message to the
- [25:19] market becomes really important. Now we
- [25:21] still do big launches. So we still have
- [25:24] everything tiered into tier three, tier
- [25:26] one. Like tier ones are going to happen
- [25:28] as like big moments that we're going to
- [25:30] really rally as a company behind and
- [25:32] it's going to be something that um is
- [25:35] meant to step function change our
- [25:36] product market fit and uh we're going to
- [25:39] do a bunch of activities behind it. But
- [25:40] at the same time, what's really
- [25:42] important to us is to maintain noise in
- [25:45] the market. And that noise in the market
- [25:47] happens by us shipping every day, every
- [25:50] other day, multiple times per day and
- [25:53] just talking about it constantly.
- [25:55] Interestingly enough, it's actually
- [25:57] works as fantastic resurrection strategy
- [25:59] because people like, "Oh, there's more
- [26:01] things here. Like, I need to go check it
- [26:02] out." It also works as great
- [26:04] re-engagement strategy. So, instead of
- [26:06] sending newsletters to say like, "Here's
- [26:08] the market trends or here's the user
- [26:09] stories." Like, people are like
- [26:10] literally logging into their social to
- [26:13] see like, "Okay, what has lovable
- [26:14] shipped now?" like what what what is the
- [26:16] change? So, it's interesting to them to
- [26:18] see because from the time that they
- [26:20] voice their opinion on what needs to
- [26:21] happen to actual delivery is so short.
- [26:24] So, they feel heard and they are heard
- [26:26] because that's how we uh prioritize all
- [26:29] of the things that we're shipping. But,
- [26:30] it's interesting because
- [26:32] I've never been in a company that tries
- [26:35] to maintain so much just shipping
- [26:37] velocity to maintain certain amount of
- [26:40] noise that it feels like the product is
- [26:42] alive. it's changing every single week.
- [26:45] And then there's like these big
- [26:46] amplifications, turbo boosts so to speak
- [26:48] in the race car model uh that then go
- [26:51] out and they fundamentally create a step
- [26:54] function change in that product market
- [26:56] fit as a whole. And uh that is a
- [26:59] retention strategy I can get behind any
- [27:01] day and all day. I only hope that we can
- [27:04] maintain it as we continue scaling.
- [27:06] >> Sounds stressful. This reminds me I had
- [27:10] Garav. He is the CEO of uh Mirage used
- [27:13] to be called Captions which is a really
- [27:15] successful AI video company startup and
- [27:17] they have a policy of you ship a a
- [27:20] marketable feature every week.
- [27:22] >> That's how their company operates and
- [27:25] it's the same thing is just ship things
- [27:26] you can talk about.
- [27:27] >> Velocity of shipping is our number one
- [27:30] core value in development team. So we do
- [27:32] anything and everything to just keep it
- [27:34] going up up up and um into the right.
- [27:37] And by the way, this is also means that
- [27:39] everybody is a little has a little bit
- [27:40] of marketer within them. This is uh we
- [27:42] have very lean product organization. We
- [27:44] actually lean on our engineers uh to do
- [27:46] a lot of product work. We call them
- [27:48] product engineers. Uh and uh they have
- [27:51] to go and they have to announce the
- [27:54] thing that they've shipped. It doesn't
- [27:55] just funnel through marketing. So
- [27:57] there's a lot of uh autonomy, a lot of
- [27:59] agency that needs to happen with this
- [28:01] with this type of velocity because
- [28:03] marketing team otherwise you have to
- [28:05] have like enormous marketing team to
- [28:06] staff that. So it has to come with some
- [28:09] roles and responsibilities uh
- [28:11] redefinition on the team as well.
- [28:13] >> Let's talk about marketing. That's
- [28:14] something else you've written about is
- [28:15] just marketing is changing in a big way
- [28:17] their role in growth. How does marketing
- [28:19] play a role in all of this? On one side,
- [28:22] marketing channels are changing. On the
- [28:24] other side, marketing's involvement into
- [28:26] everything that product does is
- [28:28] changing. And then number three, I think
- [28:30] even marketing organizations in terms of
- [28:32] where they're hired the most um are
- [28:34] changing as a result as well. So I'll
- [28:36] talk about second one first just because
- [28:38] we just talked about shipping and that
- [28:40] is um yeah you still have your product
- [28:42] marketers, you still have your channel
- [28:44] managers um but they focus more on the
- [28:46] big things and the narratives although
- [28:49] it's difficult because the narrative
- [28:50] even changes all the time as these
- [28:52] functionalities come through. Usually
- [28:55] you can come up with the positioning and
- [28:57] messaging and you can have it for years
- [28:59] and and create all of the campaigns
- [29:01] around it. Now you have it for three
- [29:02] months and then the product changes. So
- [29:05] like the cycles here are really uh
- [29:07] really short and uh for smaller changes
- [29:10] because cycles are so short they spend
- [29:12] so much time actually focusing on it as
- [29:14] they should that some of these smaller
- [29:15] changes just cannot be supported by
- [29:17] marketing. You have to delegate it to
- [29:19] your product and engineering team to do
- [29:21] their own marketing because otherwise
- [29:23] again you're going to have to have
- [29:24] enormous marketing team in order to
- [29:26] support it all. But at the same time,
- [29:28] channels in which marketing right now
- [29:30] works I think are changing quite a bit
- [29:32] and um not enough people I feel like are
- [29:34] freaking out and talking about it as
- [29:36] opposed to like moving just in the same
- [29:38] direction over and over again. And the
- [29:40] changes that I'm seeing is that it is
- [29:43] very has been very clear to me that when
- [29:46] you're talking about organic strategy,
- [29:47] if you marketing organic strategy, if
- [29:49] you asked me that five years ago, I
- [29:52] would have said that's SEO. It's search
- [29:54] engine optimization. go on Google.
- [29:56] That's your organic marketing strategy.
- [29:58] If you ask me what's the organic
- [30:00] marketing strategy right now, to me,
- [30:01] it's all about social, which is what is
- [30:04] my CEO posting? What is my team posting?
- [30:06] What is my LinkedIn? What is my creator
- [30:09] economy doing in influencer marketing?
- [30:12] And um across all of the social
- [30:14] platforms, that is my organic, which is
- [30:16] that one's kind of paid to be fair, but
- [30:18] when I think about organic, there is
- [30:19] still a lot of that word of mouth. What
- [30:21] are my users posting on social? What are
- [30:23] they talking about it? what are they uh
- [30:25] what are they sharing which is like a
- [30:27] mind shift because I've been always
- [30:29] especially in B2B so focused on search
- [30:32] and now I feel like it's been completely
- [30:34] pushed even further into consumerization
- [30:37] territory and it has become all about
- [30:39] social no matter how B2B you are because
- [30:42] that's where eyeballs are at
- [30:44] >> that is fascinating and so when you talk
- [30:46] about socials what are you finding is
- [30:48] most helpful is it Twitterx is it
- [30:50] LinkedIn is it YouTube Tik Tok Instagram
- [30:52] >> for founder socials uh O employee
- [30:54] socials um X and LinkedIn are fantastic
- [30:57] sources. Um especially for B2B because
- [30:59] that's where all of the B2B people are
- [31:02] at. But you cannot just have Chad GPT
- [31:05] write your copy and post it. You need to
- [31:07] show personality like there needs to be
- [31:10] humanity uh that it goes through it. And
- [31:13] it's not natural for everybody and it
- [31:15] feels very awkward sometimes to start.
- [31:17] Uh but it's important to people to see
- [31:20] who's building the company because
- [31:22] there's so much competition now on
- [31:24] functionality so they can rally behind a
- [31:27] team. So they want to have a team that
- [31:30] they want to win and for that you need
- [31:33] to be vulnerable. You need to be
- [31:36] authentic obviously but you just need to
- [31:38] be yourself. Uh so like that corporate
- [31:41] scrubbing has to completely fall off
- [31:43] which um is obviously going to pull in
- [31:47] as as the company scales but at least at
- [31:50] the beginning that is a chance to stand
- [31:51] out and then your customers posting
- [31:53] about you. So that word of mouth of uh
- [31:56] really creating a product that creates
- [32:00] something for customers that is worth
- [32:02] talking about. It gives them stories
- [32:05] that they want to share that feels
- [32:07] empowering to them to tell to others
- [32:10] like they're unlocking a secret like
- [32:12] they feel proud of what they have
- [32:13] created which what we focus a lot on
- [32:16] lovable on to have that feeling of oh my
- [32:18] gosh I have superpowers now and I can't
- [32:20] wait to tell others I cannot wait to
- [32:23] show others what is happening so on both
- [32:26] of those sides to me that is very much
- [32:28] organic um if you're in a consumer then
- [32:30] Instagram Tik Tok um are very much a go
- [32:33] as well.
- [32:34] >> So here it's uh the CEO clearly is an
- [32:37] important uh variable in this them in
- [32:39] this case Anton just tweeting here's
- [32:41] what's going on lovable here's how fast
- [32:42] it's growing here's some we've learned
- [32:44] >> uh we had the CEO of gamma uh on
- [32:46] recently Grant and he's exactly the same
- [32:48] thing just sharing a bunch of lessons
- [32:50] journey building in public a big part of
- [32:51] the growth lever and your point here is
- [32:53] okay so it's the co but then it's also
- [32:55] how do you get your customers to share
- [32:56] things on socials and then there's a
- [32:59] paid uh influencer sort of component
- [33:01] >> yes uh the customer is difficult one,
- [33:03] that's a word of mouth loop that you
- [33:05] need to stand up. The only way to create
- [33:07] a word of mouth loop is just to blow
- [33:09] their socks off uh when they actually
- [33:12] experience your product. We have a
- [33:14] really almost unfair advantage because
- [33:16] our product is called lovable. So by
- [33:19] default, we're trying to create an
- [33:20] absolute lovable experiences. Like that
- [33:23] is a mentality internally. If it's not
- [33:25] lovable, we're not going to ship it. So
- [33:28] uh and the best way to fix a bug at
- [33:30] lovable is to say this is not lovable.
- [33:32] like when everybody's just like jumps on
- [33:34] it. Uh to fix it right there and then
- [33:36] sprints, no sprints, it doesn't matter.
- [33:38] It's getting fixed right now. So, uh
- [33:40] from that perspective, we kind of have
- [33:42] that culture already embedded as part of
- [33:45] our brand and it's part of our name,
- [33:46] which helps us a lot. But that's the
- [33:49] point is that you feel that brand
- [33:50] through every interaction. Uh I talk to
- [33:52] my designer all the time. How can we add
- [33:54] more love marks into the product? How
- [33:56] can we prioritize more unique
- [33:58] interactions? the little elements that
- [34:00] make up that that feeling of this
- [34:03] product is speaking to me. It's like it
- [34:04] feels something like that is unique. It
- [34:06] has personality uh behind it. So we put
- [34:09] all of the brand work actually into our
- [34:11] product. When you think about lovable
- [34:14] think people think about a brand but we
- [34:16] don't have a brand marketing team yet.
- [34:18] So it's all just through product
- [34:19] interactions and some of those building
- [34:22] and public moments of the people behind
- [34:25] uh those product interactions. Um that
- [34:27] is our strategy. And then there's
- [34:28] influencer marketing. Interestingly
- [34:30] enough, influencer marketing is 10 times
- [34:32] bigger for us than paid social. So yeah,
- [34:35] we do some paid social as well. Um, and
- [34:37] it's working decently. It's quite
- [34:39] expensive from payback period. Um, we're
- [34:42] still optimizing it. As I said, we're
- [34:43] pretty early on in all of these
- [34:45] channels, but influencer marketing is
- [34:47] something that has worked uh from the
- [34:48] beginning. a lovable and uh reason
- [34:51] behind it is that influencer marketing
- [34:53] especially on the socials it gives you
- [34:55] an opportunity to have a little video
- [34:57] and interaction and lovable is all about
- [34:59] seeing like oh my gosh this is what I
- [35:01] can do and uh this is possible so that
- [35:05] drives people to go and try it
- [35:06] themselves so that's why social works
- [35:08] very well for us because it's not really
- [35:10] a written value proposition like nobody
- [35:12] knows what bite coding is but you watch
- [35:14] 10 seconds of it and you go that's new
- [35:17] let me go give it a try
- [35:18] >> who would have thought that a head of
- [35:20] growth who is traditionally seen as like
- [35:23] data metrics, spreadsheets, drive KPIs
- [35:26] is like, okay, how do we make this more
- [35:28] lovable? How do we add more moments of
- [35:30] delight? I know my my my joke is like at
- [35:33] the end of my lovable journey whenever
- [35:36] hopefully never comes to an end, but but
- [35:38] at the end I'll be like a growth brand
- [35:41] person here. Here, hi, my name is Elena.
- [35:43] I do brand now. But I I actually see it
- [35:46] as part of growth strategy to make sure
- [35:48] that that brand shines through every
- [35:50] single interaction. Um and I always talk
- [35:53] to my team about it because that is one
- [35:56] big lever in our growth story.
- [35:58] >> Yeah. So I think that's a really
- [36:00] important point to highlight. The reason
- [36:01] Lovable is growing so fast is it is a
- [36:03] product people love. You've made
- [36:05] something people want and the word of
- [36:07] mouth spreads because it's something
- [36:08] that blows people's socks off as you
- [36:10] said. So it feels like that's the first
- [36:12] thing you got to get right.
- [36:13] >> Yes. Well, the first thing you have to
- [36:15] get right is you have to be at the right
- [36:17] place at the right time and you have to
- [36:18] be in fastmoving waters. Like let's not
- [36:20] discount how fast this category is
- [36:22] exploding on its own. So this cannot
- [36:24] happen in every single category that
- [36:26] you're starting to build a product. But
- [36:28] the way to stand out in the super
- [36:30] crowded category is to create
- [36:31] experiences that speak to people. That I
- [36:34] think is something that a lot of people
- [36:35] deprioritize because they still
- [36:37] prioritize functionality over humanity
- [36:40] within software. And I think that we're
- [36:42] actually moving to the new era of
- [36:44] software that needs to feel human that
- [36:46] people want to interact with not just
- [36:49] utility of it because cost of software
- [36:51] is coming down so much to develop that
- [36:55] we now can actually invest into
- [36:57] emotional feel of that software as
- [37:00] opposed to only just focus on creating
- [37:02] the utility out of it. So to me it's um
- [37:06] it's a I I I love this move because I I
- [37:09] hate nothing more than going to software
- [37:11] that is just like so painful to use that
- [37:13] I lose some brain cells uh as I'm
- [37:15] interacting with it versus software that
- [37:17] I feel I get energy out of and for
- [37:20] lovable for me like I cannot wait on
- [37:22] some of the projects that I have to go
- [37:24] and vibe code myself like that's the
- [37:25] highlight of my day and I just like I
- [37:28] don't I I I bring in my daughter and I'm
- [37:30] like let's go do this like what do you
- [37:31] think that needs to be done because I
- [37:33] just get so energy out of doing it and
- [37:35] uh that is the feeling you cannot create
- [37:38] by looking at it as a utility problem.
- [37:41] >> The way I think about it, the way what
- [37:43] you're describing is it's almost table
- [37:44] stakes have increased and now it's so
- [37:47] easy to build. Now the big
- [37:49] differentiator is experience, design,
- [37:50] delight.
- [37:52] >> Exactly. And it has to translate through
- [37:54] every single interaction. So your
- [37:56] designer has to be one of your first
- [37:57] hires now in startups. It's not just
- [38:00] about the the engineering so to speak
- [38:03] utility and you have to think through
- [38:05] every single interaction of does this
- [38:07] communicate our brand or not.
- [38:09] >> So along those lines I want to come back
- [38:10] to something you talked about which is
- [38:11] launching new features is a huge growth
- [38:13] lever. Kind of the big question there is
- [38:15] just how do you maintain quality and
- [38:17] cohesiveness as all these people are
- [38:19] empowered to ship stuff. Is there
- [38:20] anything else there you've seen that
- [38:22] works well to help avoid just a
- [38:24] Frankenstein product just endless
- [38:26] features that you want to tweet about?
- [38:28] Yeah, one part of it is not something
- [38:31] that you can codify, but it's the type
- [38:33] of people that you hire that are going
- [38:34] to go and ship these things. We at
- [38:37] Lovable try to hire the absolute best
- [38:39] talent available out there that we can
- [38:41] bring in and that we can source and that
- [38:43] we can attract uh to grow with. And what
- [38:46] do I mean by that best talent? Um it's
- [38:48] not that somebody who has been at really
- [38:50] large companies or somebody that has
- [38:51] really uh done a lot of logos or has big
- [38:54] success stories behind them. It's
- [38:56] somebody who is extremely passionate
- [38:57] about their job. It's their hobby. They
- [39:00] love to work. They have fire in their
- [39:02] belly. This is not a paycheck for them.
- [39:04] They want to do this for some ulterior
- [39:07] reason. This is the biggest opportunity
- [39:10] of their life. So this is global maxima
- [39:13] against any other opportunities that are
- [39:15] in front of them at the moment. So
- [39:17] that's very important for us. We want
- [39:19] people to come and do their absolute
- [39:20] best work at lovable. It's very
- [39:22] important and you can feel it in this
- [39:24] office. People are wired up. They are so
- [39:29] high on how can we make this better? How
- [39:32] can we deliver more to our customers?
- [39:34] And that's very different compared to
- [39:37] usually how companies grow. We're like,
- [39:39] okay, yeah, the check, check, check.
- [39:40] They fit the skill set. Let's bring them
- [39:42] in. But is that passion? Is that fire
- [39:44] behind it? And then uh the second piece
- [39:47] is that um we work really hard on just
- [39:50] addressing what's the success here looks
- [39:52] like? What is it that we're building?
- [39:54] what use cases are we building for? And
- [39:56] then because we hire these people that
- [39:59] are so passionate about it, the other
- [40:00] two skills, by the way, that are super
- [40:02] important is high agency and high
- [40:03] autonomy, I can figure out things that
- [40:05] are tangential to me that I don't need
- [40:08] other specialty, so to speak. Like I
- [40:10] don't need a marketer to go launch
- [40:12] something. I can go figure it out and I
- [40:14] have high agency. I can go do it myself.
- [40:16] Um I'm going to own it from all the way
- [40:19] from start to finish. uh those are very
- [40:21] important, something that we screen for
- [40:22] and something that we look for in our
- [40:24] culture and then uh you just see what
- [40:28] you want to do is up to you. So there's
- [40:30] very little supervision that happens on
- [40:32] the ground. Um now we all have a goals
- [40:35] and like some of the big launches that
- [40:36] we're all marching towards but some of
- [40:38] the work um that is completely up to
- [40:41] developers up to uh marketers or
- [40:43] whatever what is it that they want to
- [40:44] do. So there has to be that enablement
- [40:47] of go try things and because of our
- [40:50] velocity if you fail it's not a big deal
- [40:52] we'll just pivot we'll go we'll get
- [40:54] we'll get through it we are not here to
- [40:57] just win all the time
- [40:59] >> on the hiring of these incredible people
- [41:02] as we all know it's very hard to hire
- [41:03] people these days especially the best
- [41:05] what have you seen lovable does
- [41:07] differently or does well that helps them
- [41:08] recruit the best
- [41:10] >> yes and especially recruit in Stockholm
- [41:12] I mean the main office here is in
- [41:14] Stockholm we're asking a lot of people
- [41:15] to relocate uh which is a no small feat.
- [41:18] Now some of it is um makes it easy
- [41:20] because of how much hype we created
- [41:22] around our product. People want to come
- [41:24] work for us like there's um they're
- [41:26] reaching out to us. They're saying I I
- [41:28] love what you're doing. I want to join
- [41:30] it. Uh so that we have a cheat code to
- [41:33] it because like we have most of the time
- [41:35] when we reach out to somebody they say
- [41:37] yeah I would love to explore. So uh
- [41:40] building that product that is highly
- [41:42] lovable also creates a really great
- [41:44] recruiting brand for you as well. So
- [41:46] make sure that there like multiple
- [41:48] benefits to that. But uh second of all
- [41:51] we do a lot of trials uh for people. So
- [41:54] trial work to see them in action
- [41:56] >> a work trial to see them in action for a
- [41:59] couple of days. We pay them as part of
- [42:00] the work trial. We have uh some
- [42:02] probation periods that we start people
- [42:04] on uh because this company is not for
- [42:06] everybody. As I start said in the
- [42:08] podcast in in the beginning, the pace
- [42:11] here is insane. I went on vacation uh
- [42:14] for the first time. So I've been here
- [42:16] for 6 months. I went on vacation um for
- [42:19] 10 days. I came back. I felt like I
- [42:21] needed to on board from the beginning.
- [42:24] Like everything changed. And when I'm in
- [42:26] it, I feel like it's an evolution. But
- [42:29] the fact that just being gone for 10
- [42:31] days, it feels like a complete
- [42:32] revolution in the company. It's that
- [42:34] pace is just not for everybody. And
- [42:36] that's okay because I'm very firm
- [42:38] believer that there's different cultures
- [42:40] and different environments that the best
- [42:42] fit for different personalities and
- [42:43] different people. So we try to be very
- [42:45] upfront with how things are and how
- [42:49] chaotic they are. And we prioritize
- [42:51] people that don't look for clarity but
- [42:53] can create clarity out of chaos because
- [42:57] um it is absolutely chaotic otherwise.
- [43:00] And if we start to look for people that
- [43:03] can explain it uh to us, that's the only
- [43:05] way that we can succeed.
- [43:06] >> The way you describe going on vacation
- [43:08] and feeling very different, it feels
- [43:09] like when you don't see your kid for a
- [43:11] few days and they're just like
- [43:12] completely different. You're like, "How
- [43:13] did you grow so fast in 3 days?"
- [43:15] >> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Let me try to
- [43:18] summarize the growth levers that you're
- [43:20] finding is are working. And I'm trying
- [43:22] to think about this from the perspective
- [43:23] of uh an AI startup trying to think
- [43:25] about, hey shoot, how do we grow faster?
- [43:27] What is lovable figured out? So feels
- [43:30] like number one is just uh build
- [43:32] something lovable, something that blows
- [43:33] people's socks off, but also in a market
- [43:36] that is growing that people want to pay
- [43:38] money for like you can build something
- [43:39] lovable that nobody actually cares about
- [43:41] that there isn't much money going to the
- [43:43] space. There's no tide pushing it
- [43:45] forward and it won't work. I call it
- [43:47] minimum lovable product. Like it
- [43:48] shouldn't be minimum viable product
- [43:50] anymore. Viability is left in back in
- [43:54] 2020 2010s. Now it's minimum lovable
- [43:57] product. That's the only thing that
- [43:58] matters.
- [43:59] >> I love how these AI tools are letting us
- [44:01] you know like PMS have always had these
- [44:03] um what are they uh smoke door test or
- [44:06] like what's the term just like or is
- [44:08] that not a real product? Uh
- [44:09] >> painted door.
- [44:10] >> Painted door. There it is. Yeah. And and
- [44:13] it's like okay we just have a landing
- [44:14] page. There's nothing there. And now AI
- [44:15] makes it easier to do that and it's like
- [44:17] more fullfeatured.
- [44:18] >> Yeah. Well, it's the feedback cycle is
- [44:20] just completely collapsed. You can go
- [44:22] from idea to some product uh that is
- [44:26] functioning to user feedback within a
- [44:28] day if you want to. I mean depending on
- [44:30] how fast that you want to run or how
- [44:31] complex the product is for missions. It
- [44:34] took us couple of weeks to vip code it
- [44:36] to the point to where because we also um
- [44:38] I have a full-time vip coder on my team.
- [44:41] He's amazing. So like he he wanted to
- [44:43] create videos like he did a bunch of
- [44:45] designs for it uh too. So we he he took
- [44:48] him a couple of weeks. We're testing it
- [44:49] now and then we'll push it in the
- [44:51] product. But it's a completely different
- [44:52] development life cycle. Before uh it
- [44:55] would just take so many more steps uh
- [44:57] from user research to uh the design
- [45:00] sprints uh to prioritizing on
- [45:03] engineering roadmap to build something
- [45:05] minimal and and viable to actually test
- [45:08] to little long testing cycles. Now it's
- [45:10] just like boom, let's go. Uh, it's taken
- [45:12] us could have taken us a day. We just
- [45:15] decided to take a couple of weeks to get
- [45:17] all of the video pieces correct.
- [45:18] >> I saw you launched this on LinkedIn. I
- [45:20] to me it looked like a a full product
- [45:22] launch. Uh, it is interesting to hear.
- [45:24] This is just a sort of prototype.
- [45:26] >> Yes.
- [45:27] >> Prototype.
- [45:28] >> Minimum level.
- [45:29] >> Minimum level. Okay. Uh, I got to ask
- [45:31] you have this. You said you had a
- [45:32] full-time vibe coder. What the heck is
- [45:34] this? Is this like an engineer? Is this
- [45:36] something else? What is a full-time vibe
- [45:38] coder?
- [45:38] >> Great question. This is a new job role
- [45:40] that is actually popping up here and
- [45:42] there. Uh it's absolutely fascinating to
- [45:44] watch uh this development because I see
- [45:46] vibe coding as a skill being added to a
- [45:49] lot of job descriptions for designers,
- [45:51] for product managers, uh for marketers,
- [45:54] which I think is a really interesting
- [45:55] shift. Finally, Excel can move over like
- [45:58] we have a new skill to add that is um
- [46:00] super empowering and and not three years
- [46:04] old, but uh vibe coder. So uh his name
- [46:07] is Lazar and he actually was chief of
- [46:10] staff in his previous role. So he's not
- [46:11] technical at all. He's self-taught uh in
- [46:14] technical aspects of it but he was very
- [46:17] early on in the vibe coding wave. So he
- [46:20] learned a lot about it. He was um user
- [46:23] of all of the vibe coding tools lovable
- [46:25] included. And uh when I was coming into
- [46:28] the role I'm like I have so many
- [46:29] projects that I will vibe code myself.
- [46:31] So I run this uh woman only hackathon
- [46:34] she builds. I vip coded the first
- [46:36] version of that site and like and
- [46:39] submission process for applications and
- [46:41] then other people came in and started
- [46:43] building on top of it. But I vip code
- [46:45] but then like I don't have enough time
- [46:47] sometimes because I need to run around
- [46:49] and I want to push out so many different
- [46:51] initiatives that I want to test in the
- [46:52] market with our own products. So um we
- [46:56] connected on social um like can you like
- [46:58] would you join us and he joined us for
- [47:00] uh part-time uh like you're bringing so
- [47:02] much value for example we partnered with
- [47:05] Shopify and he created a bunch of
- [47:06] Shopify lovable templates uh by coded
- [47:09] for us and it's been so helpful uh to
- [47:12] have somebody like that that is just
- [47:13] like pushing all all of these things out
- [47:15] and he's an absolute expert so he's
- [47:17] teaching us all too of what is possible
- [47:20] with lovable because he's on the cutting
- [47:21] edge of constantly pushing it to the
- [47:23] limit. So, I I really enjoy having that
- [47:27] role, which I've never had before in my
- [47:29] life and in my team.
- [47:31] >> I I'm not surprised. I've I've never
- [47:34] heard of this role before as a real
- [47:35] full-time job. Do you think this is a
- [47:37] thing people will start hiring for at
- [47:38] non vibe coding companies?
- [47:41] >> So, I vibe code myself. So, like I would
- [47:43] put that as even as a skill on my on my
- [47:45] resume now. It took me a while to figure
- [47:47] out by the way like everybody's like,
- [47:48] "Oh, you just go and like it and it all
- [47:50] happens automatically." It takes you a
- [47:52] couple of iterations, couple of projects
- [47:54] until like you know, okay, this is this
- [47:56] is how I need to translate it, how I
- [47:58] need to think about it. But for me, it's
- [48:00] when I started scaling of what I want to
- [48:02] vibe code. That's where his value really
- [48:04] came in because I'm like, okay, I
- [48:06] understand what is possible. I know what
- [48:08] needs to be achieved. And some of these
- [48:10] apps I want to be almost full-blown
- [48:12] built uh because they're not going to
- [48:14] get incorporated into the product
- [48:15] anytime soon. They don't need to be.
- [48:17] I'll just link to them from uh from our
- [48:19] headers, so to speak. and uh he really
- [48:21] accelerated that velocity for me. So
- [48:23] once you get into VIP coding and you see
- [48:26] its value within your organization,
- [48:28] leaning into somebody like that just
- [48:30] accelerates your velocity because it is
- [48:32] like an engineer uh on your team. It's
- [48:34] just they're not to me he's his part his
- [48:37] part technical but they can be
- [48:38] nontechnical if they're really good.
- [48:40] >> That is fascinating. This episode is
- [48:42] brought to you by Persona, the verified
- [48:44] identity platform helping organizations
- [48:46] onboard users, fight fraud, and build
- [48:49] trust. We talk a lot on this podcast
- [48:51] about the amazing advances in AI. But
- [48:54] this can be a double-edged sword. For
- [48:56] every wow moment, there are fraudsters
- [48:58] using the same tech to wreak havoc,
- [49:00] laundering money, taking over employee
- [49:02] identities, and impersonating
- [49:03] businesses. Persona helps combat these
- [49:06] threats with automated user, business,
- [49:08] and employee verification. Whether
- [49:10] you're looking to catch candidate fraud,
- [49:12] meet age restrictions, or keep your
- [49:14] platform safe, Persona helps you verify
- [49:16] users in a way that's tailored to your
- [49:18] specific needs. Best of all, Persona
- [49:20] makes it easy to know who you're dealing
- [49:22] with without adding friction for good
- [49:23] users. This is why leading platforms
- [49:26] like Etsy, LinkedIn, Square, and Lyft
- [49:28] trust Persona to secure their platform.

- [49:44] Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring
- [49:45] this episode. Let me kind of go back to
- [49:47] summarize just real quick the growth
- [49:49] lovers. I want to move in a somewhat
- [49:50] different direction. So things that help
- [49:52] Lovable grow. One is just build
- [49:54] something in mind that blows your socks
- [49:55] off as you said. Uh I love these phrases
- [49:57] out here. The second is uh make noise in
- [50:00] the market. And the way that Lovable
- [50:03] does this SEO is tweeting constantly.
- [50:05] You build something that blows people's
- [50:07] socks off so that they share things on
- [50:10] socials themselves. Plus, this
- [50:11] influencer marketing component and just
- [50:14] this idea of building in public has been
- [50:16] really helpful. This point about
- [50:18] activation being kind of uh embedded
- [50:20] within the product team of the AI exper
- [50:22] of the AI agent essentially. So, it's
- [50:24] essentially not the growth team thinking
- [50:26] about activation. It's the product team
- [50:27] that is building the AI magic that is
- [50:30] obsessed with activation and it feels
- [50:32] like those are the main the main growth
- [50:34] levers. Is there anything else that I
- [50:37] missed?
- [50:38] >> Community. I think community is really
- [50:40] important here because you need to bring
- [50:42] people together as they're exploring
- [50:44] these capabilities and as they're seeing
- [50:46] what's possible so they can bounce off
- [50:48] each other and they can help each other
- [50:49] out. So I would say community also
- [50:52] amplifies that word of mouth. It
- [50:53] amplifies all of the social posting. It
- [50:55] it amplifies retention mechanisms uh for
- [50:58] you as well. But community has been a
- [51:00] huge part of lovable success as well and
- [51:03] that's something that was started very
- [51:04] early on. It runs on discord so it's
- [51:07] nothing fancy. It's not like we build
- [51:08] anything completely from scratch for
- [51:10] ourselves. Um and it has hundreds of
- [51:12] thousands of members and it's um it's
- [51:15] very lively. We have community managers
- [51:18] that are making sure that all of the
- [51:21] questions get answered and the right
- [51:22] groups are being created. We have
- [51:23] incredible ambassador pro program now as
- [51:26] well of people uh doing it. So I would
- [51:29] say community here again of really
- [51:32] making software more human is very
- [51:35] important role. Now now obviously not
- [51:38] everybody can build a community but
- [51:39] maybe at least plugging in into
- [51:40] somebody's community is uh quite
- [51:42] important as well. And then there's
- [51:44] another one unless you have a question
- [51:46] on community.
- [51:46] >> No keep going. Another one is uh giving
- [51:49] your product away a lot. And for AI
- [51:53] products, it may feel counterintuitive
- [51:56] because they're so costly. Every single
- [51:58] interaction with an AI product cost
- [52:00] companies something. There's an LLM pass
- [52:03] through cost uh that is coming through.
- [52:06] And uh a lot of especially traditional
- [52:08] tech companies I see are gating AI
- [52:10] immediately behind a pay wall because uh
- [52:13] they're sitting on a really cush um high
- [52:16] margin profile. And the moment that you
- [52:18] start giving AI away for free, you're
- [52:20] like cutting into those uh margins with
- [52:23] like a like a knife through the butter.
- [52:26] Now, at the same time, AI being so new
- [52:29] and the capabilities being so new, you
- [52:31] have to remove the barrier of entry. You
- [52:34] have to give a lot of your product away
- [52:35] for free. But by the way, I don't just
- [52:37] mean premium. Premium to me is just like
- [52:40] a baseline. If you're in the new
- [52:42] category, you need to let people explore
- [52:44] what it is for free and get that initial
- [52:47] wow moment. It's not a ha moment, by the
- [52:49] way. It doesn't need to be aha moment
- [52:51] anymore. It just needs to be a wow
- [52:52] moment. And for lovable is that first
- [52:54] preview generation after your first
- [52:56] prompt, even though it's absolutely not
- [52:59] going to be complete thing of what you
- [53:00] want to build, but you just go this is
- [53:03] possible like I had no idea I want to
- [53:05] keep building. And it becomes an
- [53:06] addictive exercise. But we also give so
- [53:09] many of our lovable credits away to
- [53:12] every event to every hackathon. If you
- [53:14] want to host a lovable hackathon, we
- [53:16] will sponsor it and give all of the
- [53:18] participants credits away for free. So
- [53:19] we give them away as candy and we uh
- [53:22] basically track them over our LLM cost
- [53:24] on premium and giveaways as our
- [53:26] marketing costs and it doesn't go into
- [53:29] our uh something we need to reduce uh to
- [53:33] make our margins better. It goes into
- [53:35] this is something that we need to spend
- [53:37] more in because this is part of our
- [53:39] growth secret sauce.
- [53:41] >> Okay, I want to hear more about the
- [53:42] growth secret sauce. That is extremely
- [53:44] interesting. Uh I haven't heard of that
- [53:45] as a strategy and I can see why this
- [53:48] makes sense. If the strategy is blow
- [53:50] people's socks off so they could tell
- [53:51] their friends, post on all the socials.
- [53:53] The trick is get more people to try it.
- [53:55] And so this is and and it's such a new
- [53:58] crazy thing. Like why would I pay money?
- [53:59] Why would I even go take the effort to
- [54:01] like try sign up for an account if I
- [54:03] don't know what this is? because I don't
- [54:04] know what I'm doing with it. So, I could
- [54:05] see how this loop goes faster and faster
- [54:08] by giving it away.
- [54:10] >> Exactly. And again, this is very
- [54:12] uncomfortable sometimes for companies
- [54:14] that a either used to really AI
- [54:16] companies have lower profile of margins.
- [54:19] That's absolutely true. We to find an AI
- [54:22] company with 80 90% margin profile is
- [54:24] absolutely impossible. Let's be real.
- [54:26] We're all sitting somewhere in the 40%
- [54:29] uh or so, which is a lot smaller. So any
- [54:32] time that you look at those AI costs as
- [54:35] your cost center, that's when you're in
- [54:37] trouble. You fundamentally have to flip
- [54:39] the script and say, "I need to expose to
- [54:42] people of what is possible and I need to
- [54:44] remove the monetization friction out of
- [54:46] it." Because if you don't, nobody's ever
- [54:48] going to try it or you're going to be
- [54:50] very easily overtaken by a competitor
- [54:52] that will give it away. And let's face
- [54:53] it, once you hook people, they're more
- [54:55] likely going to stay with you. So you
- [54:56] obviously have to still work on the
- [54:58] retention strategy there. But if you can
- [55:00] have like for our case if somebody one
- [55:02] of our users stands up and say hey I'm
- [55:04] gonna have a hackathon at my work
- [55:07] unlovable
- [55:09] can you give us all some free credits to
- [55:12] play with why would we prevent a person
- [55:15] who wants to do all of the marketing and
- [55:17] activating job for us in their company
- [55:20] from using us? Of course we're like take
- [55:23] it. How much do you need? How much would
- [55:25] you like? We will sponsor it all. We
- [55:27] will give you anything that you need.
- [55:28] So, we're really leaning into people
- [55:30] that are wanting to show this magic to
- [55:32] those around you and empowering them as
- [55:34] much as possible. And um that is
- [55:36] something that is actually applies to
- [55:38] every single product. And I agree, this
- [55:40] is not a growth strategy that I've ever
- [55:41] applied in my life on like giving
- [55:44] product away as much as possible, but it
- [55:46] is something that uh is more and more
- [55:48] becoming something that I see that is
- [55:50] absolutely non-negotiable.
- [55:52] >> What I'm feeling is like the more
- [55:54] mind-blowing it is, the more you should
- [55:55] give it away for free.
- [55:56] >> Yeah. especially in a competitive market
- [55:58] where everyone is you know it's hard
- [56:00] there's like so many companies trying to
- [56:02] do this thing and so um so it's almost
- [56:04] like the better you are the more you
- [56:06] should give it away
- [56:07] >> right right
- [56:08] >> and this also explains why uh so much VC
- [56:10] money has to be raised for these sorts
- [56:11] of companies because this is not cheap
- [56:13] like you said you're paying all these
- [56:14] foundational models a lot of money
- [56:16] >> yes and no uh because I'm only going to
- [56:19] say no is because so take a look at
- [56:21] lovable we're two over 200 million in AR
- [56:24] at this point we're 100 people charge.
- [56:26] So our headcom count costs are
- [56:28] >> very Let me just let me just make sure
- [56:30] people hear that. 200 millionaire I
- [56:33] didn't realize 100 people work at
- [56:35] Lovable.
- [56:36] >> Yes. And 6 months ago we had 30 people
- [56:38] working at Lovable. So we triple. So for
- [56:40] us it's a really big deal. We tripled
- [56:42] our company size. Uh we're going to
- [56:43] quadruple it by the end of Yeah. I know
- [56:46] >> we're big boy and girls now. But for for
- [56:49] perspective of the headcount cost, it's
- [56:51] minimal. So we have very little in that
- [56:54] going on. We are not spending a lot on
- [56:56] paid marketing. So, we're not a big paid
- [56:59] marketing driver. Yeah, we're spending
- [57:00] on influencer marketing, but it's not
- [57:02] majority of our growth. It's uh low
- [57:04] double digits uh to to be fair because
- [57:06] it's it's not why we're successful. It's
- [57:09] amplifying our success and it's helping
- [57:11] us reach new audiences. Uh we don't have
- [57:13] really large sales team. We have only a
- [57:15] couple sales folks um and they're just
- [57:17] starting to ramp up their enterprise
- [57:18] efforts. So, we don't have like really
- [57:21] big enterprise demand gen costs as well.
- [57:23] So from that perspective, if you like
- [57:26] look at the equation and you say, well,
- [57:28] okay, if you're not going to do a lot of
- [57:29] paid marketing, if you're not going to
- [57:31] do a lot of sales because we're really
- [57:33] only working on hand raisers of people
- [57:35] that are saying right now that they want
- [57:36] to buy lovable, then where is like you
- [57:39] don't have big costs. So you can spend
- [57:41] it on product and that is the beautiful
- [57:43] part because you're not when we're
- [57:45] giving our product away to our
- [57:46] customers, we're not competing with
- [57:48] other companies in that space because
- [57:51] they're just going to use lovable in
- [57:53] their hackathon on their own and we're
- [57:55] not competing on AdWords or like in paid
- [57:58] Google where everybody's buying real
- [58:01] estate for eyeballs. So from that
- [58:03] perspective is I think about it more as
- [58:05] a shift of where we spend and cost and
- [58:08] honestly it's more efficient way to do
- [58:11] paid marketing almost in a sense uh
- [58:14] because of the cost per eyeball that we
- [58:16] get there is quite a bit lower compared
- [58:18] to if we were trying to compete it on
- [58:20] Google. So yes and no to your statement
- [58:24] because it actually does not deteriorate
- [58:26] margin profile. We're just shifting of
- [58:29] where we're spending it. That is an
- [58:31] incredibly important point you're making
- [58:32] there. So it's not like uh you're
- [58:34] generating an incredible amount of
- [58:36] revenue. Uh so there is money available
- [58:39] to spend and what you're saying is
- [58:41] because it's been spreading through word
- [58:43] of mouth mostly. You're not spending
- [58:45] tons of money on salespeople. You're not
- [58:47] spending tons of money on paid ads.
- [58:49] >> This is just uh an amazing way to get
- [58:51] more people to use it. So it's kind of
- [58:53] like a marketing cost.
- [58:54] >> This is productled growth.
- [58:56] >> Yeah.
- [58:57] >> To the max. Supercharged. Yes. because
- [59:00] you're literally using your product to
- [59:03] drive that awareness by giving it away
- [59:05] to the agents in your ecosystem that
- [59:09] will do that distribution for you.
- [59:11] >> So fascinating. What a what a wild world
- [59:14] we're living in. Free stuff for
- [59:15] everyone.
- [59:16] >> Yes. Yes. I mean, it's great for
- [59:18] consumers. This is a great time to be a
- [59:20] consumer. You have so many options. Like
- [59:22] everybody's throwing themselves at you,
- [59:24] giving your product away for free. So,
- [59:26] it's great to be in the market right
- [59:28] now. I think it's the the power should
- [59:30] be with consumer always but with
- [59:32] software power has not been with
- [59:34] consumer previously because we were
- [59:36] forced to use towards some solutions
- [59:38] because of either how they were chosen
- [59:40] for us or what was available in the
- [59:41] market and now that supply is almost
- [59:43] infinite the demand of from the
- [59:46] consumers can be very picky and the one
- [59:49] that serves the best will win
- [59:52] >> and I think again it's important to
- [59:53] highlight this is not some kind of VC
- [59:54] subsidized bubbleish sort of thing like
- [59:56] there is a lot of money being generated
- [59:58] that you are spending to help it grow
- [01:00:00] faster. It's not like some kind of we're
- [01:00:02] just raising more money to give away
- [01:00:03] more money. Like you're actually making
- [01:00:05] real money. It's not driving it's not
- [01:00:06] driven by VC money.
- [01:00:07] >> I I I can't comment on specific margin
- [01:00:11] details for us. Uh but at the same time,
- [01:00:14] the money that we're raising on VC is
- [01:00:16] for future development and hardening our
- [01:00:18] business.
- [01:00:19] >> Uh not because we will not be able to
- [01:00:21] survive without it.
- [01:00:22] >> Awesome. Okay, great segue too. I want
- [01:00:23] to talk about product market fit and
- [01:00:25] competition. you had this really
- [01:00:26] interesting post that I don't think
- [01:00:27] people uh grasp yet, which is that
- [01:00:31] product market fit is no longer this
- [01:00:33] like we've done it product market fit
- [01:00:35] and we're up and to the right now we
- [01:00:37] just grow grow now we hire sales people
- [01:00:39] it's going to be great uh you've written
- [01:00:40] that just product market fit is no
- [01:00:42] longer this like you've done it and
- [01:00:43] you're good it's this endless fight to
- [01:00:46] keep it talk about what you're seeing
- [01:00:48] there
- [01:00:48] >> so I'll first start with what I've felt
- [01:00:51] at least before when people were talking
- [01:00:54] about product market fit
- [01:00:55] that yeah obviously always product
- [01:00:57] market fit is an evolving thing but the
- [01:00:59] rate of that evolution was measured in
- [01:01:01] years and what is it that you need the
- [01:01:03] next product market fit step function
- [01:01:05] change which often was called second
- [01:01:07] horizon or third horizon sometimes five
- [01:01:10] 10 years sometimes even longer that you
- [01:01:12] need that you depending on how good your
- [01:01:14] and hardy your initial product market
- [01:01:16] fit was but you'd spend years scaling
- [01:01:18] the original product market fit it was
- [01:01:20] like blitz growth stage marketing sales
- [01:01:23] growth was very important um that you
- [01:01:25] just try to get it to as many people as
- [01:01:27] possible and then once you have
- [01:01:28] saturation or the cost to getting to the
- [01:01:30] marginal people becomes too high, you
- [01:01:32] start thinking, okay, what else can I
- [01:01:33] offer to help me reach additional people
- [01:01:36] or sell more to existing users that I
- [01:01:38] already have? And again, the main point
- [01:01:40] here is it would take years to get to
- [01:01:43] that stage where it became a question
- [01:01:45] that you had to face um really hard face
- [01:01:48] to face. Now it's 3 months and all of a
- [01:01:52] sudden you have to face that question
- [01:01:54] again and it's happening because of two
- [01:01:55] things in my opinion. Number one in AI
- [01:01:59] technology of what LLM is capable of
- [01:02:02] doing changes still very rapidly with
- [01:02:05] new model release with each new model
- [01:02:07] release. So I think we're going to I
- [01:02:10] think we'll stabilize at some point and
- [01:02:12] it's going to become more marginal but
- [01:02:14] we're not there yet. So every 3 months
- [01:02:16] or so, every single AI LLM provider
- [01:02:19] creates a step function change on what
- [01:02:21] is possible with that LLM. And when you
- [01:02:25] have this new possibility in just an
- [01:02:27] underlying technology that opens up in
- [01:02:29] front of you, then it creates another
- [01:02:31] ceiling of what is possible to build on
- [01:02:34] top of it. And the tricky piece here is
- [01:02:38] that it's not enough to just wait for
- [01:02:40] that technology to get better and then
- [01:02:42] start building on top. you have to build
- [01:02:44] beforehand to like make a bet and then
- [01:02:47] it's the LLM to catch up because when
- [01:02:49] that model releases you already need to
- [01:02:51] have that functionality available. So
- [01:02:53] that piece is I've never been in a
- [01:02:55] company where the fundamental
- [01:02:58] capabilities are still changing so
- [01:03:00] rapidly and that's the product part. So
- [01:03:02] the product can leap to the new
- [01:03:04] expectations but let's not talk about
- [01:03:06] the market part as well. Consumer
- [01:03:09] expectations have never changed this
- [01:03:11] fast before. what we expected Chad GPT
- [01:03:15] to be able to do and answer and how we
- [01:03:17] wanted it to talk to us eight months ago
- [01:03:20] versus now is night and day and like the
- [01:03:23] deep thinking mode and uh the like the
- [01:03:25] how how how deeply it can go into
- [01:03:28] answering questions and what is capable
- [01:03:29] of being building on top of it. So
- [01:03:31] consumer perception has never changed
- [01:03:33] this fast too is this unprecedented time
- [01:03:36] of consumers all of a sudden like in a
- [01:03:38] month saying oh it's not doing this yet
- [01:03:42] like I'm bouncing before again consumer
- [01:03:44] perceptions would be years to take it's
- [01:03:46] actually technology would sometimes be
- [01:03:48] able to already address it but consumer
- [01:03:50] perception has not not been changed yet
- [01:03:52] so it would take a long time so we're
- [01:03:54] like in this really weird part where
- [01:03:56] both product and market is shifting so
- [01:03:57] rapidly that every 3 months I feel like
- [01:04:00] we have to recapture our product market
- [01:04:03] fit and not just recapture on the same
- [01:04:06] technology and with same customers. It's
- [01:04:08] both of those pieces of the equation
- [01:04:10] change every 3 months. And it's
- [01:04:13] terrifying in a way. It's also very
- [01:04:15] confusing in a way because we're $200
- [01:04:18] million company and we're not solely
- [01:04:20] focused on marketing and sales because
- [01:04:23] we still have to recapture our product
- [01:04:24] market fit. And you know that the team
- [01:04:26] that finds your product market fit is
- [01:04:28] very different than the team that
- [01:04:30] usually scales your company. Yet we have
- [01:04:32] to find the team that is capable of
- [01:04:34] doing both on ongoing basis. Now I think
- [01:04:37] every AI company is in on this product
- [01:04:40] market fit treadmill. Uh hopefully that
- [01:04:43] treadmill speed slows down. If not I
- [01:04:46] think we're going to come up with like
- [01:04:47] crazy things of what this LLM and AI
- [01:04:49] will be able to do if it's going to
- [01:04:50] continue at this cusp. But um it's a
- [01:04:53] weird place to be in because every 3
- [01:04:56] months we have to throttle on our
- [01:04:58] scaling efforts and just reinvent and
- [01:05:02] then scale again. But it's like short
- [01:05:04] blitz of growth, not these long
- [01:05:06] year-long commitments. What makes this
- [01:05:08] very real is just this week apparently
- [01:05:11] OpenAI had this whole code red moment
- [01:05:14] where even though OpenAI by far the
- [01:05:17] leading AI assistant over almost a
- [01:05:20] billion I think monthly active users
- [01:05:22] like basically synonymous with AI around
- [01:05:24] the world with Gemini 3 launching their
- [01:05:26] market share just started to dip really
- [01:05:28] quickly. I think they lost like six
- [01:05:30] something% in like a week. And so even
- [01:05:34] OpenAI like chat GPT the original the
- [01:05:37] one that everyone uses constantly is is
- [01:05:39] is in danger.
- [01:05:40] >> It's like nobody's nobody's future is
- [01:05:43] bulletproof yet. And 10 years ago, if
- [01:05:46] you asked me if a $200 million company
- [01:05:48] was at risk in losing product market fit
- [01:05:50] in the next three months if it's
- [01:05:52] experiencing 10% month- over-month
- [01:05:54] growth, I would have said, "You're
- [01:05:55] crazy." And now that's the reality that
- [01:05:58] we live in. And I I I don't know. I it's
- [01:06:02] fascinating to world. And what a time to
- [01:06:04] be alive.
- [01:06:04] >> What a time to be alive. And uh very
- [01:06:07] stressful, but the prize at the end is
- [01:06:09] massive. That's the, you know, that's
- [01:06:10] why this is worth doing. Uh not just,
- [01:06:12] you know, monetarily, but just the
- [01:06:14] impact it's going to have on the world,
- [01:06:15] the way we people build and ship.
- [01:06:16] >> Exactly. Exactly. The ceiling of what is
- [01:06:19] possible has been raised so massively
- [01:06:20] that we haven't even became too closest
- [01:06:24] to even see it. I believe so I think
- [01:06:27] that that's the exciting part of it.
- [01:06:29] >> The way I've seen you write about this
- [01:06:30] product market fit challenge is the
- [01:06:33] traditional approaches you have these
- [01:06:34] like core users that are using it happy
- [01:06:36] with it and then you expand to the
- [01:06:37] adjacent users and expand to the next
- [01:06:39] and you're basically just trying to
- [01:06:40] recapture that same core constantly and
- [01:06:42] don't even have time to go adjacent.
- [01:06:44] Yeah, I Bengali wrote a really wonderful
- [01:06:47] article. It was many years ago at this
- [01:06:49] point on adjacent user theory and that
- [01:06:51] your product market fit expansion when
- [01:06:54] you're in no growth stages. The biggest
- [01:06:55] opportunity for you to go after is this
- [01:06:57] what he called adjacent user which are
- [01:06:59] just outside of your core user. They
- [01:07:02] have uh somewhat similar needs but maybe
- [01:07:04] they're in different geo maybe they have
- [01:07:06] slightly different use case, slightly
- [01:07:08] different needs. and your biggest way to
- [01:07:10] continue growing your product market fit
- [01:07:12] without having to go to next horizon is
- [01:07:13] to capture those um that next
- [01:07:16] group of users. The interesting piece
- [01:07:18] here of how I relate to it, we still
- [01:07:20] have the core users and by the way those
- [01:07:22] core users are mostly pioneers right now
- [01:07:24] that are excited by the capabilities.
- [01:07:26] Then there's latent majority that is
- [01:07:28] filled with adjacent users. And the
- [01:07:31] issue right now which I'm actually quite
- [01:07:33] worried about us like as a category is
- [01:07:35] that we're constantly focusing on
- [01:07:37] recapturing the pioneers. We don't have
- [01:07:39] time to go after adjacent users and I'm
- [01:07:43] worried of whether there's going to be a
- [01:07:44] gap in the space where we actually going
- [01:07:47] to alienate the latent majority because
- [01:07:50] we're so hyperfocused on just staying
- [01:07:52] top of mind and t top of capabilities on
- [01:07:56] the pioneers. But I don't know the right
- [01:07:58] answer here because without the pioneers
- [01:08:01] they'll like you need pioneers for a
- [01:08:03] latent majority to follow. But if you
- [01:08:06] take pioneers and you take them too far
- [01:08:09] into capabilities, will latent majority
- [01:08:11] never be able to catch up? Uh maybe this
- [01:08:14] is a fruitless concern, but it's just
- [01:08:16] like something that I think about
- [01:08:17] because at this stage we should be
- [01:08:19] working on adjacent users and and I
- [01:08:22] would argue maybe OpenAI definitely
- [01:08:24] started have uh to do that with so many
- [01:08:27] people they have on their platform, but
- [01:08:29] not most of the other AI companies.
- [01:08:31] >> I completely see what you're thinking
- [01:08:32] there. Like a brand could just become
- [01:08:34] known as that's just for like startups
- [01:08:36] and prototyping and it's not for serious
- [01:08:37] work.
- [01:08:38] >> Yeah. Or it's like it's for just like
- [01:08:40] for it's for techies. It's like for tech
- [01:08:43] people. It's like it never actually
- [01:08:44] enters the people uh outside of our
- [01:08:48] little bubble that we live in.
- [01:08:50] >> We kind of touched on this a little bit
- [01:08:51] of just like working in AI, working on
- [01:08:54] AI companies. Uh challenging, stressful,
- [01:08:57] a lot of work. What's your advice for
- [01:08:59] folks that are thinking about should I
- [01:09:01] join a lovable? Should I join a cursor?
- [01:09:03] Should I just go work at Google Micros?
- [01:09:05] You know, not not to throw them under
- [01:09:07] the bus or anything, but just although
- [01:09:08] Google very very successful in AI now,
- [01:09:10] maybe less AI focused company.
- [01:09:13] >> I really believe that there's different
- [01:09:15] you need to understand what's the
- [01:09:16] environment that is right for you. Just
- [01:09:18] please understand that AI companies are
- [01:09:21] very hectic at the moment. They're very
- [01:09:23] unstable by definition of that product
- [01:09:26] market fit treadmill about that
- [01:09:28] distribution of how they're actually
- [01:09:30] distributed to the market really
- [01:09:31] changing about how product is even being
- [01:09:33] developed in the first place. So if you
- [01:09:35] are very comfortable in being in that
- [01:09:37] messy middle and uh really comfortable
- [01:09:39] of converting chaos into clarity for you
- [01:09:43] and those around you then yeah AI
- [01:09:45] company is a wonderful place for you to
- [01:09:47] really absorb new skill sets right now
- [01:09:50] because I even before joining lovable
- [01:09:52] when I kept seeing AI I'm like my gosh
- [01:09:55] like I'm so tired of seeing AI
- [01:09:57] everywhere. Is it really changing the
- [01:09:59] world? Like is it really changing the
- [01:10:01] way people work? And when I was um I was
- [01:10:03] at Dropbox before and yeah, we would use
- [01:10:05] AI here and there and I would use
- [01:10:07] CHIGPT. I've never used AI there the way
- [01:10:09] I use AI at lovable and the things that
- [01:10:12] I'm capable of accomplishing at Lovable
- [01:10:14] and I don't know if I've ever would have
- [01:10:16] made that leap so fast unless I joined
- [01:10:18] Lovable. If I would have just read or
- [01:10:20] listened about it, it's just different
- [01:10:22] compared to be surrounded by people
- [01:10:24] where it's expectation. It's not like a
- [01:10:27] nice to have or something that
- [01:10:28] somebody's asking you to do. This is
- [01:10:30] just how you get things done and you
- [01:10:32] have to think about everything of like
- [01:10:33] what can AI do here versus where do I
- [01:10:36] add value versus like in a traditional
- [01:10:39] sense of work is like I start with my
- [01:10:41] own value and then I augmented with AI
- [01:10:44] and here like the mindset is completely
- [01:10:46] uh shifted. Now I don't think AI is
- [01:10:48] replacing everybody's job. So like
- [01:10:50] please don't like don't look at it as a
- [01:10:51] as as that cliche saying. I actually
- [01:10:55] often call AI as like average
- [01:10:57] intelligence that helps me get the
- [01:10:59] platform up and then I add my human
- [01:11:01] thinking and my human creativity on top
- [01:11:04] of it to get it to the next level. But
- [01:11:06] at least I can get this base level done
- [01:11:08] with AI really freaking quickly. So from
- [01:11:11] that perspective, I think if you want to
- [01:11:13] leaprog on what it means to be AI native
- [01:11:16] employee and how to use all of these AI
- [01:11:18] tools, you should go to AI company. But
- [01:11:21] if you know that your superpower is in
- [01:11:23] more structure, in more definition, in a
- [01:11:26] really high specialty of things, because
- [01:11:29] in AI companies, they're all fairly
- [01:11:31] small. So, you'll have to generalize
- [01:11:32] quite a bit and have a lot of ownership
- [01:11:35] of areas that you usually maybe not have
- [01:11:37] ownership over, then you shouldn't join
- [01:11:39] it because AI companies will evolve to
- [01:11:42] be more stable too. So, it's just a
- [01:11:44] matter of time on where you can join. So
- [01:11:46] I would just urge people to look at
- [01:11:47] their superpowers and the type of
- [01:11:49] environments that really speak to them
- [01:11:51] so they can feel happy because this can
- [01:11:55] lead to burnout for wrong type of
- [01:11:58] personalities very quickly.
- [01:12:00] >> Yeah. My sense is if you want work life
- [01:12:02] balance, don't join one of these
- [01:12:04] companies because that's just not the
- [01:12:05] way they work.
- [01:12:06] >> I don't know if I'd go that far. I mean
- [01:12:09] I have family. I have two kids. I feel
- [01:12:11] like I have a very good work life
- [01:12:12] balance. Uh, but I put in boundaries for
- [01:12:15] myself. Like I know when I need time
- [01:12:17] off, I need because I know when my brain
- [01:12:19] starts to overheat, so to speak. Uh, but
- [01:12:22] I I also know that work is my hobby and
- [01:12:24] it's my passion and I will this is the
- [01:12:28] best work of my life that I'm doing
- [01:12:29] right now. There's no other place that
- [01:12:31] I'd rather be uh than to be here. So, I
- [01:12:34] think that you just need to be more
- [01:12:36] careful about setting your own
- [01:12:38] boundaries that you know you need. But
- [01:12:41] um I mean let's face it I don't think
- [01:12:42] anybody has work life balance regardless
- [01:12:44] of a company that they work at even at
- [01:12:46] Google or like Microsoft or any of the
- [01:12:50] others. I think everybody is freaking
- [01:12:52] out and running as fast as they can.
- [01:12:55] It's just they're running it in
- [01:12:56] different structures. I'm really glad
- [01:12:58] you said that and corrected me there
- [01:13:00] that it is possible to work at a company
- [01:13:03] one of if not the fastest growing
- [01:13:05] company in history and actually uh have
- [01:13:07] work life balance to get sleep to spend
- [01:13:09] time with your kids and family.
- [01:13:11] >> You just have to protect it uh
- [01:13:13] ruthlessly but you also need to be
- [01:13:15] realistic with how much is expected out
- [01:13:18] of you and you need to feel confident
- [01:13:20] that you'll be able to deliver it. And
- [01:13:22] by the way, you won't be able to deliver
- [01:13:24] it unless you use AI in many aspects of
- [01:13:27] your work life. So that's like the piece
- [01:13:28] that helps you actually get to hit those
- [01:13:31] expectations of outcomes that you need
- [01:13:33] to do and the velocity. But um I'm I'm
- [01:13:36] very protective of my personal time with
- [01:13:38] kids. Like why did I have children if
- [01:13:40] I'm not going to spend time with them?
- [01:13:41] So like those are part of the
- [01:13:42] non-negotiables um that I bring along
- [01:13:46] with me in every single work. for people
- [01:13:48] that maybe have trouble setting
- [01:13:49] boundaries or just not good at this
- [01:13:51] anything what do you what works for you
- [01:13:52] is it just is it as easy as just telling
- [01:13:54] people here's where I need to leave what
- [01:13:56] do you what's what advice do you have
- [01:13:57] for people to set boundaries like that
- [01:13:58] >> so first of all I would not think about
- [01:14:00] it as a work life balance there's no
- [01:14:02] such thing as balance or balance feels
- [01:14:03] like oh I have enough time for
- [01:14:05] everything I don't have enough time for
- [01:14:06] anything but I prioritize my family in
- [01:14:10] some moments I prioritize work in other
- [01:14:13] moments and I don't try to balance the
- [01:14:15] two I go where I'm needed and where I go
- [01:14:17] and I feel like I'm not going to regret
- [01:14:19] the choices that I'm making today. So,
- [01:14:21] I'm constantly trying to put myself in
- [01:14:23] the future and say, well, I resent
- [01:14:24] myself if I make this choice right now.
- [01:14:26] And if the answer is yes, I don't make
- [01:14:28] that choice. And sometimes I have to say
- [01:14:30] no to Anton and say like I can't make it
- [01:14:33] or I won't be there. I need to be here
- [01:14:35] with my family or like today I need to
- [01:14:37] cancel my day. My kid is sick and he
- [01:14:39] needs me and I need to be I need to take
- [01:14:42] him to the doctor. So I think that just
- [01:14:44] making in the moment more like in every
- [01:14:47] day even sometimes in the hour decisions
- [01:14:49] to me works better than trying to
- [01:14:51] balance something that is completely
- [01:14:53] unachievable and it feels overwhelming
- [01:14:55] to even think about. But I prioritize
- [01:14:57] this in my sleep, uh my health, my
- [01:15:00] workout schedule, my kids, my family, my
- [01:15:02] husband, um and just my downtime because
- [01:15:05] I know that I'm most creative once I
- [01:15:07] have separation from work because then I
- [01:15:09] come in with like all still firing and I
- [01:15:12] have so many more ideas about it. So to
- [01:15:14] me, it's actually part of doing my best
- [01:15:16] work is to take time off.
- [01:15:18] >> That is really great advice. I want to
- [01:15:20] touch on what it's like to work at
- [01:15:22] Lovable because it feels like Lovable is
- [01:15:25] at the cutting edge of what working at
- [01:15:28] in product is going to be. So, you
- [01:15:30] mentioned a little bit about how you're
- [01:15:31] always talking to AI asking questions.
- [01:15:33] Is there any any other kind of anecdotes
- [01:15:34] of just how people operate at Lovable
- [01:15:37] that is really unique or weird or funny
- [01:15:39] or interesting that might be helpful for
- [01:15:41] people to try in their company?
- [01:15:43] >> Yeah, I mean we use Lovable at Lovable a
- [01:15:46] lot. Like all of our internal tools are
- [01:15:47] built on Lovables. Uh we actually have
- [01:15:49] our first hackathon on lovable happening
- [01:15:51] next week. Uh where we're going to
- [01:15:53] entire company is just going to take
- [01:15:55] full day to pipe code um and see what we
- [01:15:58] actually have happen. We prototype
- [01:16:00] everything on lovable. So our specs yeah
- [01:16:03] we do still have a written spec but it
- [01:16:05] always accompanied by a lovable
- [01:16:06] prototype uh that everybody can interact
- [01:16:09] with and uh to click around with and
- [01:16:11] provide feedback and everybody punches
- [01:16:13] in and also like does some edits if they
- [01:16:15] have any better ideas. So I uh create
- [01:16:18] mocks on lovable. So for example, we
- [01:16:21] need to make some pricing changes um a
- [01:16:23] pricing page changes. I take a
- [01:16:25] screenshot of our pricing page. I go to
- [01:16:27] lovable. I say recreate this pricing
- [01:16:28] page, make these changes and then I send
- [01:16:31] that to my engineering team saying hey
- [01:16:32] this is what I want to happen and then
- [01:16:34] like they take it from there. So we just
- [01:16:37] you and Chad GPT I use a lot for
- [01:16:39] brainstorming especially the deep
- [01:16:41] thinking mode. I love it. It takes a
- [01:16:43] long time but it's so worth it. Uh
- [01:16:45] sometimes it has crazy ideas, sometimes
- [01:16:48] it does. Like sometimes I was like,
- [01:16:49] "Yeah, this is like nothing new to me."
- [01:16:51] So it's not interesting, but like it
- [01:16:53] gets me thinking and it gets me look at
- [01:16:55] the different angles and um lots of um I
- [01:16:58] use Granola a lot for example because to
- [01:17:00] me it's super helpful to get AI
- [01:17:03] summaries of the meetings and it's very
- [01:17:05] powerful for me. I use Whisper Flow a
- [01:17:07] lot because I feel like I have no time
- [01:17:09] to type anymore. So I just like talk to
- [01:17:11] my phone and talk to my laptop all the
- [01:17:13] time uh in order to do it. But we're
- [01:17:15] even thinking about all of the customer
- [01:17:18] support automations uh that are done
- [01:17:20] through AI. How do we um every single
- [01:17:23] aspect of what we do is question is
- [01:17:26] asked what can AI do here first and then
- [01:17:30] how we can add ourselves into the
- [01:17:32] equation. But lovable for us uh having
- [01:17:35] unlimited credits at lovable is a pretty
- [01:17:38] awesome perk I have to say. Like I
- [01:17:40] sometimes have to pinch myself. I'm like
- [01:17:42] I get paid to VIP code. This is like so
- [01:17:44] fun.
- [01:17:45] >> I feel like that engineer or that VIP
- [01:17:46] code engineer, he's he's like actually
- [01:17:48] >> my dream job. I want his job. I feel
- [01:17:50] like I Yeah. I I got into the wrong line
- [01:17:53] of profession here.
- [01:17:54] >> Oh man. Okay. Uh is there anything else
- [01:17:57] about Lovable? Because the what I think
- [01:17:58] about actually I interviewed the
- [01:17:59] perplexity founders back in the day
- [01:18:01] years ago and they shared like before we
- [01:18:03] talked to anyone for advice we first
- [01:18:05] asked Chacha PT and I was just like that
- [01:18:08] is the most insane thing I've ever
- [01:18:09] heard. How can you possibly work that
- [01:18:11] way and now that's how everyone works
- [01:18:13] and so I'm curious just I don't know
- [01:18:15] like how I don't know how Anton works.
- [01:18:16] Is there anyone else that just like way
- [01:18:17] in the future of here's how things might
- [01:18:19] be? So for me especially for product and
- [01:18:21] growth I and even marketing at some
- [01:18:23] point it's in some capacity when I have
- [01:18:25] an idea in my head it like it sounds so
- [01:18:28] freaking cool and sometimes I can even
- [01:18:30] like I put it in paper and it's like a
- [01:18:32] this is like like we need to do it and
- [01:18:34] then like I go and try to vibe code it
- [01:18:36] and I'm like oh like this like I don't
- [01:18:38] see the magic anymore like or I can't
- [01:18:41] like I can't envision it anymore or
- [01:18:43] sometimes I'm like yeah yeah and like
- [01:18:45] there's more there's more. So to me it's
- [01:18:47] actually has helped really complete the
- [01:18:49] ideation process for me quite a bit
- [01:18:52] because then I actually try to go and
- [01:18:54] build it and it breaks down some of the
- [01:18:56] elements of what's important, what's
- [01:18:57] not. So it's taking me on product
- [01:19:01] development life cycle so much further
- [01:19:04] down and then it creates a much better
- [01:19:06] communication vehicle with my engineers
- [01:19:08] too because like I then can tell them
- [01:19:10] exactly what's important, what not. So
- [01:19:12] to me it's been great because sometimes
- [01:19:14] we envision things that are so much
- [01:19:16] better than the reality and before until
- [01:19:18] it hands it off to design like we would
- [01:19:21] never be a like designers would do it
- [01:19:22] for us and try to make it awesome versus
- [01:19:25] I often stop my ideas in tracks super
- [01:19:28] early on without pushing it forward
- [01:19:31] versus other times I might have pushed
- [01:19:32] it too for too far too long even through
- [01:19:36] design queue or even like pitching to
- [01:19:38] leadership and uh I find that very
- [01:19:41] powerful because It calibrates me really
- [01:19:43] quickly.
- [01:19:44] >> Awesome. Okay, last question. I want to
- [01:19:46] talk about something that you've written
- [01:19:47] about that is a really uh I think it's a
- [01:19:49] really important topic, something that
- [01:19:50] we should surface is you wrote this post
- [01:19:52] called I'm worried about women in tech.
- [01:19:54] Talk about what you're seeing here. What
- [01:19:56] you're noticing, what you think might be
- [01:19:58] going in the wrong direction.
- [01:20:00] >> Yeah. There's actually conflicting data
- [01:20:01] points about how um women, you're
- [01:20:04] talking about women, right? Women. Yeah.
- [01:20:07] uh there's conflicting data points about
- [01:20:09] uh how women are keeping up with AI
- [01:20:12] technology and wave because there's a
- [01:20:14] bunch of reports that has been done that
- [01:20:16] show massive gap between women adopting
- [01:20:19] AI versus men adopting AI which points
- [01:20:22] the story that um men are just like
- [01:20:24] widening the gap uh of like
- [01:20:27] accessibility for technology and whoever
- [01:20:29] is adopting AI right now is getting paid
- [01:20:31] the most gets the most opportunities I
- [01:20:33] mean we're seeing like in say in aqua
- [01:20:35] hires right now where people are getting
- [01:20:37] paid more for their talent than for the
- [01:20:39] companies that they've created and
- [01:20:41] that's like a really interesting trend
- [01:20:43] that is occurring and a lot of it is
- [01:20:44] fueled on um on this wave of AI and
- [01:20:47] women are not really present there like
- [01:20:49] if you can think about like $1 million
- [01:20:52] aqua hire that has been in the news that
- [01:20:54] is a woman like I can't think of one if
- [01:20:56] you look at AI companies and their CEOs
- [01:20:59] uh most of it is men if you if you look
- [01:21:01] at the company's composition of um in AI
- [01:21:05] companies it's mostly men. To me, this
- [01:21:07] really came to the head of when I came
- [01:21:10] to Lovable and I'm like, it's pink, it's
- [01:21:12] purple brand, it's a heart, it's
- [01:21:14] lovable. I'm like, I'm sure this is
- [01:21:16] where it's 50/50 men versus women. And
- [01:21:20] uh although we don't collect this
- [01:21:22] information, but just like through third
- [01:21:24] party um uh autofill, we saw it's like
- [01:21:28] 20% at most. And I'm like, what is
- [01:21:30] happening? Not again. Why is this again
- [01:21:32] not being adopted by women? And uh
- [01:21:35] obviously I don't know all of the
- [01:21:37] answers. Um I think that this is early
- [01:21:40] on that we can shortcut it. And by the
- [01:21:42] way, I also don't want to put this as a
- [01:21:45] indication that men are to blame because
- [01:21:47] I think men are doing wonderful job
- [01:21:50] really spearheading the horizons and
- [01:21:52] showing us what's possible and like
- [01:21:53] leading the charge. I'm just afraid that
- [01:21:56] so many women are stuck in that latent
- [01:21:58] majority that is just not catching up.
- [01:22:00] And my worry is that it's going to
- [01:22:02] affect the hirable talent. is going to
- [01:22:05] step us back again in the composition of
- [01:22:07] the workplace of the diversity and maybe
- [01:22:09] it matters maybe it doesn't like
- [01:22:11] whichever side that you s sit on but I
- [01:22:13] think that there is it's if needs to be
- [01:22:16] built for everybody in the world and for
- [01:22:18] that it needs to be built by a
- [01:22:19] representative sample of uh people that
- [01:22:22] are behind the product as well. So I I I
- [01:22:27] just find it fascinating that even when
- [01:22:29] the barrier to building has been lowered
- [01:22:32] uh versus like you don't need computer
- [01:22:34] science degree which I appreciate
- [01:22:36] there's not that many women that are
- [01:22:38] getting we're still seeing the gaping um
- [01:22:42] gap on the adoption between genders
- [01:22:46] which is just is I I I I don't know
- [01:22:48] there's like something very frustrating
- [01:22:49] about that.
- [01:22:50] >> Yeah. Uh the thing that struck with me
- [01:22:51] with from your post is there has been a
- [01:22:54] lot of progress being made in the last
- [01:22:56] decade and now AI is just kind of
- [01:22:58] turning it all back, turning it all
- [01:22:59] around. Hopefully not. I think that
- [01:23:02] we're early on enough that we can bridge
- [01:23:04] the gap. I think sometimes uh women just
- [01:23:08] need space and ability to discover it.
- [01:23:10] Uh and uh that's what we're doing at
- [01:23:12] lovable. We have this initiative uh she
- [01:23:15] builds where we have collect we have
- [01:23:17] create a hackathon for women only and we
- [01:23:20] give them unlimited access to lovable
- [01:23:21] for 48 hours and um they come together
- [01:23:24] as a community and they build together
- [01:23:25] and there's like beautiful things that
- [01:23:27] start to come out of it which I've never
- [01:23:28] anticipated before but so many women in
- [01:23:31] that hackathon for us build help for
- [01:23:34] their with their elderly parents or with
- [01:23:36] their kids or with the household or for
- [01:23:39] their church group or for the the kids
- [01:23:42] basketball team. solutions should have
- [01:23:44] hyper local, hyper relevant, very needed
- [01:23:47] for what they need in their life and
- [01:23:49] something that was never been able to
- [01:23:50] build before because of how expensive
- [01:23:53] software was because it would never
- [01:23:55] going to become potentially a hundred
- [01:23:57] million dollar companies but it also
- [01:23:59] doesn't need to be anymore. So I just
- [01:24:01] want to bring women to build more and
- [01:24:04] vibe code more so we can have more
- [01:24:06] diversity in software that is even
- [01:24:08] created because I think that we all have
- [01:24:11] a unique take on what problems that we
- [01:24:14] can solve and I want everybody's voices
- [01:24:16] to be heard.
- [01:24:17] >> I'll give the URL for shebuilds. I
- [01:24:19] pulled it up while you're talking.
- [01:24:20] Shebuilds.lovable.app
- [01:24:23] >> bitecoded on lovable minimum viable
- [01:24:26] product.
- [01:24:27] >> Minimal lovable product.
- [01:24:28] >> Minimal lovable product.
- [01:24:29] >> There it is. So when is this happening?
- [01:24:31] Is this December 15th, 18th? So it's
- [01:24:33] >> Yeah, we have it. We're running it
- [01:24:35] constantly. So our next cohort uh starts
- [01:24:38] um December 15th, but we're going to
- [01:24:41] have more. We're planning a massive one
- [01:24:42] on International Women's Day.
- [01:24:44] >> So that's the one that if you can come
- [01:24:47] join us.
- [01:24:48] >> Awesome. I don't know if you Okay, so
- [01:24:49] some glimmer of hope. I don't know if
- [01:24:50] you saw this tweet where I tagged you
- [01:24:52] the other day or maybe it was this
- [01:24:53] today. I was looking at my most recent
- [01:24:56] podcast video performance and the top
- [01:24:59] four are all women and they're all AI
- [01:25:03] oriented and they're above Stuart
- [01:25:04] Butterfields, founder of Slack, above
- [01:25:06] Gamma's CEO Grant. So maybe a glimmer of
- [01:25:10] hope.
- [01:25:10] >> Yeah, absolutely. I think there's lots
- [01:25:12] of glimmers of hope. I think we can just
- [01:25:13] all lean in and make sure that nobody's
- [01:25:16] left behind in this wave. And uh that's
- [01:25:19] not to stop people that are marching
- [01:25:21] ahead. This is just to open up
- [01:25:23] opportunities for everybody around us.
- [01:25:25] >> Awesome. And we'll link to that post if
- [01:25:26] people want to get a deeper perspective
- [01:25:28] what you're saying. Elena, is there
- [01:25:30] anything else that you wanted to share?
- [01:25:32] Is there anything else you want to
- [01:25:34] remind people of before we get to our
- [01:25:36] one question lightning round?
- [01:25:38] >> I guess the only other thing that I will
- [01:25:40] share uh is for AI companies when it
- [01:25:43] comes to hiring. It's really interesting
- [01:25:46] also the kind of the shift in the type
- [01:25:49] of personas that end up being hired that
- [01:25:51] I see for me at least it's quite
- [01:25:53] different compared to anywhere uh that
- [01:25:55] I've worked before and that is uh
- [01:25:57] there's this narrative going in the
- [01:25:59] market always that like new hire sorry
- [01:26:01] new grads have no jobs in the market
- [01:26:03] left because all of the entry-level jobs
- [01:26:05] are automated. I actually think that's
- [01:26:07] quite false because new grads especially
- [01:26:10] AI native new grads. So it's very
- [01:26:13] important for kids that are entering
- [01:26:15] into the work I shouldn't say kids young
- [01:26:18] adults that are entering into uh the the
- [01:26:21] workforce that they really know AI which
- [01:26:24] is there's another like really big issue
- [01:26:26] that our schools are not teaching AI uh
- [01:26:28] students. So, this is like something
- [01:26:30] else that we need to fix as a as a
- [01:26:32] category because otherwise we're
- [01:26:33] literally setting up our uh young for
- [01:26:35] for a complete failure. But I think it's
- [01:26:39] incredible to see some of those new
- [01:26:41] graduates come in and what they're
- [01:26:42] capable of doing. I have um we have
- [01:26:46] multiple new graduates at lovable that
- [01:26:48] are working and I learned so much from
- [01:26:51] them and you need to obviously have the
- [01:26:53] right atmosphere where people with
- [01:26:55] experience like old guard like me that
- [01:26:58] can look at the new guard and take
- [01:27:00] really hear them and see them and really
- [01:27:02] change the way that I operate based on
- [01:27:04] how they do things. So, uh, make sure
- [01:27:07] that you bring some of that fresh talent
- [01:27:09] that doesn't understand any of the
- [01:27:12] baggage that we came from and that can
- [01:27:15] really look at the future in technology
- [01:27:17] and what can unlock from a completely
- [01:27:19] new lens. So, highly recommend putting
- [01:27:22] those into your team as like little
- [01:27:25] fireballs that are going to be sometimes
- [01:27:27] hard to contain, but can start the best
- [01:27:30] the best initiatives for you forward.
- [01:27:32] And then um it's also interesting that
- [01:27:34] there's a really high demand for uh
- [01:27:36] ex-founders now for like those people
- [01:27:38] that are truly have a lot of agency and
- [01:27:41] um high autonomy. So instead of just
- [01:27:43] having people that have been working in
- [01:27:45] the corporate world, the failed startup
- [01:27:47] founders are now hot demand for a lot of
- [01:27:50] these AI companies. So like these
- [01:27:52] personas that we traditionally would not
- [01:27:54] prioritize in companies uh to to hire
- [01:27:58] are now becoming the hottest commodity
- [01:28:00] and the highest going talent which is I
- [01:28:02] think is fascinating and it's like the
- [01:28:03] wonderful thing that is changing the how
- [01:28:07] uh the culture inside operates
- [01:28:08] >> that is really interesting and really
- [01:28:10] empowering just this idea that uh if you
- [01:28:12] need gradu's hope you're not you're not
- [01:28:14] going to be out of job.
- [01:28:14] >> Absolutely. Absolutely.
- [01:28:15] >> You might have an advantage. Yeah.
- [01:28:17] >> You you do have a you have to lead with
- [01:28:18] that. That's the thing like you have to
- [01:28:20] lead with the things that you can you
- [01:28:22] are capable of achieving knowing that
- [01:28:24] what you have with AI because that is a
- [01:28:26] lot of people especially in traditional
- [01:28:28] tech or in more traditional companies
- [01:28:30] they're looking for somebody to show
- [01:28:31] them because it's really hard to figure
- [01:28:33] it out on your own uh versus coming in
- [01:28:35] and seeing and then copying.
- [01:28:37] >> Well Elena with that we reached our very
- [01:28:39] exciting lightning round because it's
- [01:28:40] your fourth time I'm not going to ask
- [01:28:41] you all the questions I always ask you
- [01:28:43] so I'm just going to ask you one
- [01:28:44] question. So Lovable is based in
- [01:28:46] Stockholm Sweden. I'm curious just like
- [01:28:48] what do you what's something you love
- [01:28:49] about Stockholm that you weren't
- [01:28:51] expecting? Is there like a food, a
- [01:28:53] restaurant, I don't know, something?
- [01:28:55] >> Well, you always have to say Swedish
- [01:28:57] meatballs. I mean, I've never liked
- [01:28:59] meatballs before. Uh so like and now
- [01:29:02] it's it's so good here. It's so good. So
- [01:29:05] like every time one of my meals here
- [01:29:08] throughout the day involves it. But I
- [01:29:10] actually really love the sounds. They're
- [01:29:12] like they're I don't know. They're so
- [01:29:15] they just taste different. It's not like
- [01:29:16] the IKEA. It's not like the IKEA Swedish
- [01:29:18] meatballs.
- [01:29:19] >> Well, I have been to IKEA here because
- [01:29:22] that is a Swedish company, too. It like
- [01:29:23] reminded me of uh in person Amazon. It
- [01:29:25] was like absolutely incredible. IKEA
- [01:29:27] here is like next level. But, uh food
- [01:29:30] food I Swedish meatballs for sure.
- [01:29:32] Honestly, how clean the city is like
- [01:29:34] it's it's kind of incredible. The
- [01:29:36] architecture like everything is so built
- [01:29:38] out. It's like picture perfect. Like
- [01:29:40] it's on the card. I don't know. It's
- [01:29:41] It's
- [01:29:44] different compared to like most of the
- [01:29:45] large cities that I've been at that are
- [01:29:47] a little bit more worn down.
- [01:29:49] >> So fun. Makes me want to visit get some
- [01:29:51] meatballs.
- [01:29:53] >> Yeah. You're in the visit during the
- [01:29:54] summer. Otherwise, the daylight here is
- [01:29:56] really is really tight during the
- [01:29:58] winter.
- [01:29:59] >> Okay, good tip. Okay. Uh two final
- [01:30:01] questions. Where can folks find you
- [01:30:02] online if they want to reach out, maybe
- [01:30:04] learn more? And how can listeners be
- [01:30:05] useful to you?
- [01:30:06] >> Yes, please find me online uh on
- [01:30:08] LinkedIn. Uh please feel free to follow
- [01:30:10] me. Always engage on my post if you want
- [01:30:12] to engage with me because that's um the
- [01:30:14] place that I always talk to people. I
- [01:30:16] have my newsletter as well um that um
- [01:30:20] baby baby steps compared to what Lenny
- [01:30:22] has, but it's elenena verna.com. I also
- [01:30:24] try to that's where I post most of my
- [01:30:26] findings that that I experience at my
- [01:30:28] work. So if you want to continue seeing
- [01:30:30] how my thinking evolves or what the
- [01:30:32] patterns that I noticed, that's where to
- [01:30:34] find me. and how to be useful to me. Um,
- [01:30:37] really pressure test my thinking because
- [01:30:39] so many things are changing right now.
- [01:30:41] I'm honestly not even sure myself of
- [01:30:43] what is a pattern versus what is just a
- [01:30:45] data point. So, I'd love to just engage
- [01:30:47] in as many conversations as possible uh
- [01:30:50] and hear your opinions because that will
- [01:30:52] help us as an industry just understand
- [01:30:55] what is actually happening and makes
- [01:30:57] more sense out of this whole thing.
