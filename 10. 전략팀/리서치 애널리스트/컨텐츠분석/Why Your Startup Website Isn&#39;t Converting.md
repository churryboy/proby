## Key insight / summary

- **제품 스크린샷의 절대적 중요성**: "Show the product"가 가장 핵심적인 피드백으로, 추상적인 일러스트레이션보다 실제 제품 화면이나 짧은 데모 영상이 방문자의 이해도를 극적으로 높임
- **애니메이션은 양날의 검**: 주의를 끌고 가치를 명확히 전달할 때는 효과적이지만, 과도하거나 모호하면 오히려 방해가 됨. 처음 만드는 사람은 항상 경험자의 피드백을 받아야 함
- **5-10초 룰**: 웹사이트 방문자가 제품이 무엇인지 이해하는 데 주어진 시간은 극도로 짧음. 대부분의 사용자는 복잡한 애니메이션을 끝까지 보지 않음
- **CTA의 단계별 설계**: "Book a demo" 같은 고부담 액션보다는 "Show me video walkthrough" 같은 낮은 진입장벽의 CTA가 전환율에 더 효과적
- **구체적 기능 설명의 중요성**: 상위 레벨의 추상적 가치 제안보다는 "unified supplier inbox", "PO tracking" 같은 구체적이고 상상 가능한 기능 설명이 사용자 이해도를 높임
- **탭 컨텐츠의 한계**: 대부분 사용자가 탭을 클릭하지 않으므로, 중요한 정보는 탭 뒤에 숨기지 말고 스크롤 연동 등의 방식으로 자동 노출해야 함
- **브랜딩 vs 정보 전달의 균형**: 일관된 시각적 테마는 좋지만, 브랜드 일러스트레이션이 실제 정보 전달을 방해하면 안 됨

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **제품 데모를 메인 히어로로**: Proby의 AI 모더레이터가 실제로 인터뷰하는 모습, 실시간 질문 생성, 응답 분석 과정을 보여주는 짧은 영상을 랜딩페이지 상단에 배치해야 함 (McKinsey 문서의 "AI moderation quality validation" 이슈 해결에도 기여)
- **구체적 기능 중심의 메시징**: "AI-powered user research"보다는 "실시간 후속질문 생성", "다국어 동시 인터뷰", "자동 인사이트 추출" 같은 구체적 기능을 전면에 내세워야 함
- **세그먼트별 차별화된 CTA 설계**: 유니콘 기업 리서처에게는 "무료 파일럿 프로젝트", 스타트업 PM에게는 "5분 데모 영상 보기" 같은 각기 다른 진입점 제공 (beachhead 전략과 연계)
- **애니메이션을 통한 가치 명확화**: Proby의 핵심 가치인 "인간 모더레이터 vs AI 모더레이터 비교"를 애니메이션으로 보여주되, 시간/비용/품질 차이를 극도로 명확하고 단순하게 표현
- **신뢰도 구축을 위한 실제 사례**: 추상적인 고객 리뷰보다는 "A사는 Proby로 리서치 비용을 월 $50K→$5K로 줄였습니다" 같은 구체적 ROI 사례를 시각적으로 제시
- **국제화 역량의 시각적 증명**: 전략문서에서 언급된 "global research capability"를 추상적 설명이 아닌 실제 다국어 인터뷰 화면이나 실시간 번역 과정으로 보여주기
- **탭 대신 스크롤 플로우**: "리크루팅 → 인터뷰 → 분석 → 리포트" 과정을 탭이 아닌 스크롤 연동 섹션으로 구성하여 전체 밸류체인을 자연스럽게 노출
- **경쟁사 대비 차별점 강조**: McKinsey 문서의 competitive analysis 부족 문제를 보완하여, UserTesting 등 기존 솔루션 대비 Proby만의 차별점을 명확한 비교표나 애니메이션으로 표현

- [00:00] Today we're joined by Yorn Van Djk, the
- [00:02] CEO and co-founder of Framer, the
- [00:05] leading website design platform. Yorn is
- [00:07] going to use his expert design
- [00:09] background to review a bunch of user
- [00:11] submitted websites that were built using
- [00:13] Framer. Welcome to another episode of
- [00:16] Design Review.
- [00:24] >> Welcome, Yorn.
- [00:25] >> Thank you. Thank you for having me.
- [00:26] >> Yeah, thanks so much for joining.
- [00:27] Awesome. Well, let's jump into some
- [00:28] website reviews. All right, first up we
- [00:30] have Lumari. So, the AI platform for
- [00:33] procurement, Lumari streamlines supply
- [00:36] chain operations with always on systems
- [00:38] that monitor, coordinate, and take
- [00:39] action from sourcing to delivery. I
- [00:41] guess my first reaction is there's a lot
- [00:43] going on here. There's a lot of
- [00:44] movement, a lot of icons coming in and
- [00:46] being spit out. The AI platform for
- [00:48] procurement, that's clear enough what it
- [00:49] is. Um, I don't have a immediate need, I
- [00:52] think, for for this solution, but yeah,
- [00:54] the the animations, um, I probably also
- [00:56] tone that down a little bit. Um, it's
- [00:59] cool that it animates, but it's a lot.
- [01:02] >> It's there's a lot going on.
- [01:03] >> Two book a demo buttons. So, good call
- [01:06] to action, but because there's also a
- [01:08] lot of orange on the page, I feel like
- [01:09] the buttons kind of get lost. Uh, they
- [01:12] sort of blend into all the other orange
- [01:14] that's going on here.
- [01:15] >> Yeah, I'd agree with that. Maybe try
- [01:16] black or try one one CTA, one large one
- [01:20] and then use the other space. I also
- [01:22] think that book a demo button. I don't
- [01:24] know if the conversion on that generic
- [01:26] sort of um CTA never never that great.
- [01:31] Imagine that I'm coming to this website
- [01:32] for the very first time. You probably
- [01:34] first need to convince me what this is
- [01:36] and what it's about before I will do
- [01:38] something as dramatic
- [01:40] >> as booking a demo, which is taking my
- [01:42] time and and now I need to be on a call
- [01:44] with a person for 20 minutes. So,
- [01:46] >> yeah, I feel like there's a lot of these
- [01:47] graphics that are kind of like vague
- [01:50] generic graphics and I'm missing
- [01:53] something real that can help anchor like
- [01:55] what is this? What does the product look
- [01:57] like? Yep. What do I use it for?
- [01:59] >> Yeah, I would agree with that. Probably
- [02:01] screenshots would help. Uh video
- [02:02] walkthrough could also help. Um it is a
- [02:05] bit high level in speaking about the
- [02:08] value proposition. Um, and maybe maybe
- [02:11] those those two things can make it a bit
- [02:13] clearer what we're looking at exactly.
- [02:16] >> We're I don't know probably 3/4 of the
- [02:17] way down the page at this point. And now
- [02:19] we're getting into some specific things
- [02:20] like a unified supplier inbox, PO
- [02:23] tracking, change management. Those are
- [02:26] some I think tangible things that I can
- [02:28] imagine how that works and what somebody
- [02:30] would use this for. Okay, so there's a
- [02:32] lot of things in here. I think one of
- [02:34] the things with these tabs is most
- [02:37] people will never click on these. So you
- [02:39] have to assume that anything that is
- [02:40] behind these tabs, people will never
- [02:43] see.
- [02:43] >> Yep. There's a there's a cool trick
- [02:45] where you can connect that to the
- [02:47] scrolling behavior. So as you scroll the
- [02:49] page, it goes from procurement
- [02:51] operations to supplier collaboration. So
- [02:53] you kind of like
- [02:54] >> take the user uh by the hand and show
- [02:56] them the context uh or the content of
- [02:59] those uh tabs. But I think I think this
- [03:01] section could be better if those were uh
- [03:03] screenshots of the product.
- [03:05] >> Mhm.
- [03:05] >> Because that's still pretty generic. Um,
- [03:08] you know, I I I don't really know. This
- [03:10] this card is not good and then the other
- [03:11] one is good.
- [03:13] >> That's kind of what the illustration is
- [03:14] hinting at.
- [03:15] >> Or am I is this a delete thing to delete
- [03:17] this card and this one is to accept this
- [03:18] one?
- [03:19] >> Yeah. So, it's it's a bit it's a bit
- [03:20] abstract. Um, what's going on and a
- [03:23] Yeah. screenshot of the product could
- [03:24] maybe solve that.
- [03:25] >> Yeah. Okay. So, integrates with all your
- [03:27] tools. So, you know, if I have a supply
- [03:32] chain business and I use all these other
- [03:34] tools, this kind of gives me confidence
- [03:36] that I can use it with all of these.
- [03:38] >> The way those logos uh animate in and
- [03:40] out, it's called ticker effect, which
- [03:41] you can use in frame. Um, let's set that
- [03:44] to 2 and then on hover uh you can um
- [03:49] make it move by half uh half speed. So,
- [03:52] it's it's a cool effect where I think
- [03:54] this is going way too fast.
- [03:55] >> Yeah.
- [03:56] >> So, slow that down. and then on hover
- [03:58] make it so that you can click on it and
- [04:01] see something uh about that uh about
- [04:04] this feature.
- [04:04] >> Yeah.
- [04:05] >> So here you probably want to see how
- [04:06] does it integrate with drive. Is that a
- [04:09] is that a twoclick action or is that a
- [04:12] you know do I have to install some
- [04:13] plugin? Uh but give the user some
- [04:15] context on on on that.
- [04:17] >> How do you feel about the thing where
- [04:18] when you scroll things animate onto the
- [04:21] page?
- [04:22] >> I depends on how it's done. I've seen
- [04:24] many examples where that's done very
- [04:26] tastefully and it feels very natural,
- [04:28] but it's hard to get that right. Uh so
- [04:31] animation I feel in general is like
- [04:32] pretty challenging to do well. Um
- [04:34] because it can can be distracting very
- [04:37] fast. If you're making the animation and
- [04:39] it's your first time, then always always
- [04:41] ask someone that that has a little bit
- [04:43] experience like what would you improve
- [04:44] here? Um because it's easy to go it's
- [04:46] very easy to go overboard with
- [04:47] transitions.
- [04:48] >> Yeah. What what are the best use cases
- [04:50] for animation? Like when would you
- [04:51] recommend that people use that? drawing
- [04:53] attention to something. That's probably
- [04:54] the number one. Um and and making
- [04:56] something like overly uh um obvious. So
- [04:59] I think in the header here like what
- [05:01] they're trying to communicate um can be
- [05:05] can be
- [05:06] >> made very clear with animation.
- [05:09] >> But this needs a little bit of work. The
- [05:10] thing that I think works is okay so
- [05:13] sources from the left
- [05:14] >> are going through Lumari. Yeah.
- [05:16] >> And then something happens on the right.
- [05:18] But that something is extremely vague.
- [05:20] It's just
- [05:22] envelopes and
- [05:25] >> so if I'm talking
- [05:29] it's trying to do especially now that
- [05:30] we've read the the rest of the website
- [05:32] but a new visitor
- [05:34] >> that we were just three month 3 minutes
- [05:35] ago
- [05:36] >> right
- [05:36] >> will not spend that much time looking at
- [05:39] this animation. So you need to simplify
- [05:41] things much more and make it extremely
- [05:43] obvious for it to for it to really work.
- [05:46] >> Yeah. You got to kind of like beat
- [05:47] people over the head with the thing that
- [05:48] you're trying to communicate, right? And
- [05:50] make it super super obvious. And then,
- [05:52] okay, so we get to the bottom and we had
- [05:54] a bunch of FAQ stuff ready to bring AI
- [05:57] to your supply chain.
- [05:59] >> Yeah, I think I think the last part of
- [06:00] the site here is a bit uh generic. I
- [06:02] think it's a okay website, but there's a
- [06:04] lot of work to be done in in the details
- [06:06] and and really nailing this. Um, and
- [06:08] then especially on the animation front.
- [06:10] >> If you had to give one piece of feedback
- [06:12] that's going to be the highest leverage
- [06:13] thing to most improve this, what do you
- [06:14] think that would be? Well, uh, show the
- [06:16] product that that'd be number one. Like,
- [06:18] I'm not going to book a demo without
- [06:20] getting us just a little bit of a taste
- [06:22] of what the product looks like and how
- [06:24] it works. So, either just a screenshot
- [06:26] or collection of screenshots or a short,
- [06:28] you know, two-minute video walkthrough.
- [06:30] >> I think that book a demo button should
- [06:32] be show me video walkthrough or like
- [06:35] show what the product looks like
- [06:37] >> to give people a really clear
- [06:38] understanding uh of of what Lumari will
- [06:42] achieve so that I can then maybe book a
- [06:44] demo.
- [06:44] >> Yeah. makes the product more real. I
- [06:46] don't know if there's a real product
- [06:47] here or if this is just a site they put
- [06:49] together really quickly with Framer. And
- [06:51] so any evidence that this is real and
- [06:54] you know they say that it's trusted by
- [06:56] these people. So I I presume there's a
- [06:58] product and people are using it which is
- [06:59] helpful. Um but yeah, I think my biggest
- [07:02] thing is like visually a lot of these
- [07:05] illustrations look nice and they fit a
- [07:07] common theme and brand that they have
- [07:08] going on. Um, but they don't communicate
- [07:11] information to me and they don't help me
- [07:14] understand the product or what it
- [07:15] actually does. And so that I think is is
- [07:18] the biggest area of improvement for me.
- [07:19] Awesome. Thank you, Lamari. Okay, next
- [07:22] up we've got a lie. Create high quality
- [07:26] presentations with AI. Okay, so we got a
- [07:28] lot of animation happening with this
- [07:30] one, too.
- [07:33] I guess one thing that's different here
- [07:34] is I I feel like I'm seeing parts of the
- [07:37] product.
- [07:39] and it's clicking around to different
- [07:41] templated slides maybe. Okay. So, I
- [07:43] think what we're seeing here is this is
- [07:45] some type of like PowerPoint, Google
- [07:48] Slides type thing that makes it easier
- [07:51] to edit templates, design slides,
- [07:56] um move content around.
- [08:00] Looks like it's got layout positioning,
- [08:02] which most slide products do not have,
- [08:04] which would uh that seems pretty cool.
- [08:06] Yeah, I mean I do think by looking at
- [08:08] this hero I have a gen general
- [08:12] understanding of what this product could
- [08:14] do. I don't know if the simplification
- [08:16] of the product's really helpful, right?
- [08:17] This is not what the product looks like.
- [08:19] This is they're taking parts of how it
- [08:22] works and showing that in this video.
- [08:24] >> So, it's a bit you kind of have to piece
- [08:25] together
- [08:26] >> what you just did. It's like, oh, it's
- [08:28] doing something with themes. It's doing
- [08:29] something with layouts without showing
- [08:32] me the actual product itself. Yeah,
- [08:34] >> I do really like that bar at the top.
- [08:36] Upgrade to pro and get a free 30-minute
- [08:38] session to perfect your deck.
- [08:39] >> Okay, so that one's positioning it for
- [08:41] making decks. And then this one and the
- [08:43] tagline's positioning it to create high
- [08:46] quality presentations.
- [08:47] >> Yeah. I find this um kind of rainbow
- [08:50] background a little distracting. It's
- [08:52] not fully a container around what's
- [08:55] happening here.
- [08:56] >> Yeah.
- [08:57] >> And so I think that made it uh made it
- [09:00] harder for me to orient around what was
- [09:01] happening.
- [09:02] >> Yeah. with the the animation that's
- [09:04] happening here. Um, all right, let's see
- [09:06] what else we got here. All right, number
- [09:08] two product of the day on Product Hunt.
- [09:11] Just used it totally crazy switching
- [09:13] from gamma to a lie. Gamma's been in the
- [09:16] news with large fund raise and things
- [09:19] seem to be going well for them. So, it's
- [09:20] clear they're trying to counterposition
- [09:22] themselves against gamma. Here,
- [09:25] we've got a lot of quotes. How do you
- [09:27] feel about some of these quotes? Like,
- [09:28] are these the type of thing that
- [09:29] resonate with you? um especially even as
- [09:32] you're thinking about the framer uh
- [09:34] product and site.
- [09:35] >> I think as if you scroll up a little bit
- [09:37] I think um if I read a headline like
- [09:39] create high quality presentations the
- [09:41] the
- [09:42] >> typically I you need to back that up
- [09:44] right like you can't you can't really
- [09:46] say that about yourself unless someone
- [09:49] >> you have some proof that people think
- [09:50] that these presentations are high
- [09:52] quality.
- [09:53] >> Um so I think that positioning wise on
- [09:55] the page that kind of works that they uh
- [09:57] put it below the fold. I don't know if
- [09:58] the qu if the quotes are really speaking
- [10:01] to the quality of the presentations.
- [10:03] >> They seem to be a bit more generic. So
- [10:05] >> yeah, I think one of the other things
- [10:06] that uh uh resonates with me is they've
- [10:08] got a headline here, which is clear, but
- [10:11] there's maybe a missed opportunity for
- [10:13] like a sub headline or something that
- [10:14] explains literally what this is.
- [10:17] >> And we spent the time to follow this and
- [10:20] try to piece together. And we went
- [10:21] through, I don't know, three or four
- [10:23] iterations of this uh animation. And I
- [10:26] think we figured it out after that, but
- [10:28] they could have just told us up front
- [10:30] and that would have saved us a bunch of
- [10:31] time.
- [10:32] >> Yeah. And most users won't spend that
- [10:33] time. That's the hard the hard challenge
- [10:36] is like you really have to make it
- [10:38] obvious if 5 to 10 seconds. That's
- [10:40] that's that's that and I think 10
- [10:42] seconds is a is a long time for people
- [10:44] to try and figure out uh if this is for
- [10:46] them.
- [10:47] >> And it's also not obvious here like they
- [10:49] said presentations, but like this could
- [10:51] be like sections on a website or
- [10:53] something too. So going deeper could be
- [10:55] good there. Okay. Uh never start from
- [10:58] scratch again. Focus on your idea, not
- [11:00] tweaking pixels. AI has all the context.
- [11:03] You have the control. Okay. So this is
- [11:06] uh a variation on a tabbed concept where
- [11:08] they've got a timer um for each section
- [11:10] to make it easy for people to to see all
- [11:13] of them.
- [11:13] >> Can you click on the sections?
- [11:15] >> Yep.
- [11:16] >> Okay. Well, I mean this is implemented
- [11:17] quite nicely.
- [11:18] >> Yep. Yeah. This good. I like the big
- [11:20] text here. A lot of times when people
- [11:22] make tabs, there's like little tiny text
- [11:24] or something and it's real easy to miss.
- [11:26] Um, but I like that that it's really big
- [11:28] and it draw my attention and I read all
- [11:31] of those headlines.
- [11:32] >> Y
- [11:32] >> I'm not sure that it communicates
- [11:36] specific things about the product. Like
- [11:38] I don't think that I read those and then
- [11:40] have a better understanding. They're
- [11:41] still kind of like marketing speak, you
- [11:44] know, like never start from scratch
- [11:45] again. Focus on your idea, not tweaking
- [11:47] pixels. AI has all the context. You have
- [11:50] control. It's like I need the like
- [11:52] literal thing to help me understand what
- [11:54] I can do with the product. And I still
- [11:55] haven't gotten that yet.
- [11:56] >> It's a bit generic.
- [11:58] >> I mean, this honestly sounds better. The
- [12:01] sub headlines here.
- [12:02] >> Yeah, the the sublines are more
- [12:04] explanatory than the the headline
- [12:06] >> and then they disappear. So, you have
- [12:07] like 5 seconds until the timer's up and
- [12:10] then it goes away. Um, which makes it
- [12:12] difficult to to read. But these seem to
- [12:14] be the sub headlines here seem to be the
- [12:16] most uh compelling explanatory thing for
- [12:19] helping me understand what's going on.
- [12:20] Um presentations created. Okay. So
- [12:22] here's some examples I guess is what
- [12:24] we're seeing here.
- [12:25] >> I mean this is good.
- [12:26] >> Yeah.
- [12:26] >> It's giving me example of of um of what
- [12:29] type of output that I can expect. I
- [12:32] think um one thing that's hard, it
- [12:35] depends on the audience, but if you're
- [12:36] making a claim that something's really
- [12:38] high quality,
- [12:39] >> then your your benchmark for what is
- [12:41] high quality is different than mine is
- [12:43] different than everyone in the room. And
- [12:44] so if you're saying high quality, then
- [12:47] this needs to be high quality, right?
- [12:49] Like by for everyone's standard.
- [12:51] >> Yeah.
- [12:52] >> And so the output that I'm seeing this
- [12:55] um generate is looks it looks good, but
- [12:58] it's also it's pretty generic, right? I
- [13:00] think this type of output, it feels a
- [13:02] bit templated.
- [13:04] >> Um, so I think maybe the positioning of
- [13:06] this product could more be about speed
- [13:09] and ease of use, uh, if that's what
- [13:11] they're going for with AI
- [13:13] >> and less so about, you know, positioning
- [13:15] it at it as like a premium,
- [13:18] >> you know, most high quality solution.
- [13:20] Yeah.
- [13:20] >> And that's sometimes hard to get right,
- [13:21] like trying to be honest about what the
- [13:24] value proposition of your product is
- [13:26] >> versus the things that you also want it
- [13:28] to be.
- [13:29] >> Yeah. These do have cons like similar
- [13:31] formats but with different skins
- [13:33] applied. Yeah. Is is what I'm seeing
- [13:35] here.
- [13:36] >> Try for free.
- [13:37] >> So that's good. It's a good call to
- [13:38] action down there.
- [13:39] >> Are you compelled to try it?
- [13:42] >> Yeah. I think if I wanted to make some
- [13:43] presentations and I could just, you
- [13:44] know, click this try for free button. I
- [13:46] think I probably would.
- [13:49] Uh but this is a missed opportunity.
- [13:52] Force me to sign up. I think it'd be
- [13:53] even cooler if I could try it and then
- [13:55] when I wanted to export it or, you know,
- [13:58] get a share link or something like that,
- [13:59] then it forced me to to sign in. So, I'm
- [14:02] already committed.
- [14:02] >> Yeah. Yeah. Maybe this is a good product
- [14:04] to just have the prompt bar on the front
- [14:06] page. See you, you know, just let me
- [14:08] type in I want to make a presentation
- [14:10] about Y Cominator, see what it
- [14:11] generates.
- [14:12] >> Yeah. I I think one of the biggest
- [14:13] things is you want people to um get to
- [14:15] the aha moment. You know, how can you
- [14:17] get somebody to experience the value of
- [14:19] the product as quickly as possible? And
- [14:21] this is like the biggest blocker you
- [14:24] could possibly put up is just login or
- [14:27] create an account.
- [14:28] >> Yeah, if you can let people try the
- [14:30] product first or even some some demo
- [14:32] modes, it's probably it's probably good.
- [14:34] >> Yeah. I think one of the tricky things
- [14:35] also is especially for a product like
- [14:37] this like you're competing against
- [14:39] Google Slides. Yeah.
- [14:40] >> You know, which is free and everyone has
- [14:42] access to and they've probably already
- [14:43] messed around with and so trying to get
- [14:46] people in as quickly as possible I think
- [14:48] is actually really important. making it
- [14:49] really frictionless because you're
- [14:51] competing against a lot of free stuff
- [14:52] also. Awesome.
- [14:53] >> Cool.
- [14:54] >> Thank you, Eli. Next up, we've got
- [14:56] Juicebox.
- [14:58] >> Now, this looks cool.
- [14:59] >> Win the talent war. Juicebox is the AI
- [15:02] recruiting platform that understands who
- [15:05] you're looking for. Level up your team
- [15:06] with search, CRM, and agents.
- [15:08] >> The things that uh that uh jump out to
- [15:11] me is like they have a pretty um
- [15:13] distinct unique style going for it. And
- [15:16] that's something that I immediately
- [15:17] noticed from the tiny purple button that
- [15:20] says new try juice box agents to that
- [15:23] sort of
- [15:24] >> corner flap situation.
- [15:26] >> Yeah, you can't can't do anything with
- [15:27] it. But
- [15:28] >> yeah, but um it's pretty clear that
- [15:30] someone's, you know, been looking at the
- [15:32] details of what this looks like. Um if
- [15:34] it's an aesthetic that you're that
- [15:36] you're excited about or not, that um
- [15:38] depends on your own taste. But yeah, I
- [15:40] think this looks looks pretty
- [15:41] interesting.
- [15:42] >> Yeah. Um, if if I understand what it's
- [15:44] for, win a talent war, use books. AI
- [15:46] recruiting platform. Yeah. Okay. This
- [15:48] understands what you're looking for. So,
- [15:50] they're saying, "We will help you find
- [15:53] really high quality people based on some
- [15:56] inputs, I guess." Yeah.
- [15:57] >> Yeah. That's that's my guess as well. I
- [15:59] like this headline, win the talent war.
- [16:01] It gets your attention. And I think it
- [16:02] also speaks to the people that feel like
- [16:04] they're in a talent war, you know,
- [16:06] trying to find the best people to come
- [16:07] to their company.
- [16:08] >> Yeah. Got a bunch of logos, recognizable
- [16:12] companies, which is really cool. Got
- [16:13] Cursor, Corora, Perplexity. A lot of
- [16:15] these seem like very um like modern uh
- [16:19] AI era companies, too, which is cool.
- [16:22] It's not like a bunch of big dinosaurs.
- [16:24] It's it's kind of communicating to me
- [16:26] that um modern companies on the cutting
- [16:28] edge with AI are using Juicebox to to
- [16:31] help recruit.
- [16:32] >> And this is cool. Let's try it.
- [16:34] >> Try it out. Okay. Who you looking to
- [16:37] hire?
- [16:38] Um, a AI for uh video marketer
- [16:46] or the framer
- [16:49] design
- [16:51] team just because we were talking about
- [16:53] that just now
- [16:57] >> getting hit by the
- [16:58] >> Are you compelled to sign up?
- [17:00] >> I mean, I I would now I would probably
- [17:03] go back and see what the product looks
- [17:05] like first.
- [17:06] >> Okay. So you'd hit the back button here.
- [17:08] >> Yeah.
- [17:08] >> What are the things you'd want to see
- [17:10] here?
- [17:10] >> This is it's already quite good. I think
- [17:14] making it more clear what's going to
- [17:16] happen next. Uh I think that that
- [17:18] illustration is not bad. Welcome to
- [17:20] people GBD. I can kind of guess based on
- [17:22] the front page messaging. They're going
- [17:24] to help me find people. Um I think that
- [17:27] trusted buy section kind of like uh
- [17:31] works as well. Just emphasizing that
- [17:33] there's a couple of companies already
- [17:35] using this. But then this globe
- [17:37] situation with a bunch of tiny texts is
- [17:40] kind of hard like expert in
- [17:42] >> HR tech. Okay. So they're saying there's
- [17:43] a lot of people around the globe and we
- [17:45] can find them for you. So all in all I
- [17:47] think um it's okay but it's a kind of
- [17:51] missed opportunity to let me put
- [17:53] something in the prompt box and instead
- [17:55] of doing something with that information
- [17:57] and showing it to me just first uh
- [17:59] putting this roadblock up.
- [18:00] >> Okay. So yeah I think my takeaway is
- [18:02] like this is cool. It gets you right to
- [18:04] it. You would have tried this. you did
- [18:06] try it. Um, but there wasn't enough
- [18:08] information for you to like fully go
- [18:09] through with it when you hit the
- [18:11] roadblock at the next one. And my hunch
- [18:13] is that comes down here. Okay.
- [18:15] >> So, yeah, this is popping in. Okay, now
- [18:17] I'm getting more information. This is
- [18:19] kind of confusing to me. I guess it's
- [18:20] showing me different profiles and then
- [18:22] telling me stuff about their experience.
- [18:25] >> No, no, no. I think they're trying to
- [18:26] piece give you an example. So, it it it
- [18:29] u wrote this for us. Software engineers
- [18:32] in SF working at series B companies. And
- [18:34] then if you were to click that then
- [18:36] these are the candidates that pop up.
- [18:38] >> Okay, that was not obvious to me.
- [18:41] Recruiting is being rewritten a lid
- [18:43] precision driven and built for teams
- [18:45] that demand speed and results. Okay,
- [18:49] how it works. Humans plus agents
- [18:54] talent discovery across. Okay, so
- [18:56] they've index a bunch of profiles.
- [18:59] Uh they give you insights around them.
- [19:02] I don't see insights in here.
- [19:06] And then boost replies with automated
- [19:08] outreach. Okay, cool.
- [19:10] >> I do think that the way that this works
- [19:12] uh we were just discussing with the
- [19:14] other one where you scroll down and just
- [19:15] goes through the tabs for you
- [19:17] automatically shows you a picture of
- [19:20] >> it's still a this doesn't feel like the
- [19:22] actual UI but you know
- [19:25] >> a metaphor of it like this this is
- [19:27] clearly saying like we'll give you some
- [19:29] charts and bars.
- [19:30] >> Yeah. to look at. Um I don't know if
- [19:32] that's all that compelling. I would
- [19:34] probably try
- [19:35] >> Yeah, this one I think should be
- [19:36] improved. It's not clear to me.
- [19:37] >> Yeah.
- [19:37] >> What's happening here? This one is like,
- [19:39] okay, there's a lot of profiles that we
- [19:41] found. So, that makes sense to me. Um
- [19:44] and then this one is it's autodrafting
- [19:45] and you see a placeholder first name and
- [19:47] cool. Yeah, that seems pretty.
- [19:49] >> I do think that uh visually the I I
- [19:52] think this looks all of this looks
- [19:53] pretty fresh and modern.
- [19:55] >> Yeah.
- [19:56] >> Yeah, it looks great. Um, and then you
- [19:58] can see actually all the way up at the
- [20:00] top, Juicebox raises 36 million led by
- [20:02] Sequoia.
- [20:03] >> That's great.
- [20:04] >> Um,
- [20:04] >> congrats guys.
- [20:05] >> Deploy AI agents for every recruiter.
- [20:10] >> Yeah, they keep popping up all these
- [20:11] little cards and this feels overwhelming
- [20:13] to me rather than helping me get new
- [20:15] information.
- [20:18] >> Yeah, a lot of a lot of notifications
- [20:20] about random things.
- [20:22] >> Yeah, they feel like notifications.
- [20:24] That's that's the right word. which is
- [20:27] stressful.
- [20:29] Um, search on autopilot gets better with
- [20:32] every hire. Outreach that feels
- [20:33] personal. Okay. Um, okay. This is a cool
- [20:37] way to to show off what the integrations
- [20:39] are.
- [20:40] >> Yep.
- [20:41] >> Um, it's visually interesting. It makes
- [20:44] me look at all of them.
- [20:47] How top teams win with Juicebox. Okay.
- [20:49] So, we got some case studies. Is this a
- [20:51] sidescroller? It doesn't seem to want
- [20:53] to. Oh, there's a thing here.
- [20:57] Okay. Coin tracker saved a bunch of
- [21:00] hours. Monte Carlo filled some
- [21:01] positions. Okay, cool.
- [21:04] See what's coming next in AIdriven
- [21:06] recruiting.
- [21:08] Okay, so product. Okay, so this seems
- [21:09] like their product blog or something
- [21:12] announcing new features. Um, that's kind
- [21:15] of cool because it tells me like they're
- [21:16] just shipping stuff. Um, you know, you
- [21:19] can even look at the dates here and
- [21:20] October 2nd, October 3rd, October 21st,
- [21:23] November 12th. Like that tells me like
- [21:24] this product's constantly getting
- [21:26] better.
- [21:26] >> Yep.
- [21:28] >> Um then we got an FAQ.
- [21:33] >> Cool.
- [21:34] And then call to action.
- [21:36] >> O I would make that um sign up the this
- [21:40] part or try it for free.
- [21:42] >> I assume you put in the email and it
- [21:43] takes you to the next step.
- [21:44] >> Yeah. But why not put that prompt box in
- [21:47] here as well?
- [21:47] >> Yeah.
- [21:48] >> Like try to get people in the product.
- [21:50] >> Yeah. I mean this this also works but
- [21:52] it's just a bit more generic where if
- [21:54] you have the opportunity to get some
- [21:55] user intent and then yeah
- [21:57] >> everybody needs to do this framer also
- [21:59] does this you want to make a website
- [22:00] >> it works right like
- [22:02] >> when people want the thing they sign up
- [22:04] um another thing maybe that could be
- [22:05] interesting is uh based on the query
- [22:08] that you put in to show profiles but
- [22:11] maybe they're blurred out or something
- [22:13] and to give people a snippet of like
- [22:14] we've got it you know you just got to
- [22:16] put in the thing here and you'll be able
- [22:18] to see it overall I I thought this is uh
- [22:20] really great website Juicebox. Like it's
- [22:22] clear they've invested the time and it
- [22:24] feels unique. It feels like uh a brand
- [22:27] that I would remember. Um and it's all
- [22:30] very thoughtful in the way they're
- [22:31] communicating the product.
- [22:32] >> Like aesthetically, I think this looks
- [22:33] very very uh modern and and sort of like
- [22:37] maybe AI forward in a way. It's a bit
- [22:39] brutalist, which I kind of like.
- [22:42] >> That's an on trend style now.
- [22:44] >> Yeah, it it is on trend. But then the
- [22:46] disconnect for me is a bit about okay
- [22:48] but if this is about people it feels
- [22:50] very distant from being a people
- [22:53] solution right it's helping me hire
- [22:55] someone
- [22:55] >> but it's very black and white and the
- [22:59] hints of color there pretty sparse
- [23:01] purple little bit of blue and then the
- [23:03] name for me with the logo is that that
- [23:06] that feels probably the most
- [23:08] disconnected from from the solution that
- [23:11] it's trying to be
- [23:11] >> that is a great point there there aren't
- [23:13] a lot of people's faces and humanness to
- [23:16] it. I I guess we have a couple avatars
- [23:18] there, but outside of that, there
- [23:19] doesn't seem to be much.
- [23:21] >> Yeah. I And I do like that, you know,
- [23:23] win the talent war, but it's also kind
- [23:24] of it sounds pretty heavy-handed for a
- [23:27] product that's called juice box,
- [23:29] >> right?
- [23:29] >> Talent war. See what I'm saying? Yeah.
- [23:31] >> Yeah. And the style, it's interesting
- [23:33] because the style of this actually looks
- [23:35] a lot more like an Anderil or Palunteer
- [23:38] or something like that, right? Which is,
- [23:40] you know, literal war for a lot of them.
- [23:43] And uh this is not that finding talent,
- [23:45] but uh it definitely got my attention
- [23:47] reading that. Awesome.
- [23:48] >> Great job, Juicebox. Next up, we've got
- [23:50] Leaping AI.
- [23:52] >> Automate your call center with voice AI.
- [23:54] Human-like AI voice agents to replace
- [23:56] your whole complex call center. Trusted
- [23:59] by enterprises and large call centers to
- [24:01] deliver the same or better customer
- [24:03] satisfaction than human agents at scale.
- [24:06] Okay, so everything about this is
- [24:08] telling me this is for large call
- [24:10] centers, enterprises at scale, doing
- [24:13] better than humans, complex. It's like
- [24:16] every word in here is just hitting at
- [24:18] like if you have a complex large call
- [24:21] center like we are the solution for you.
- [24:23] >> Yep. Yeah. I think uh the positioning
- [24:24] and the text very clear what it is. My
- [24:28] first reaction to the layout and how
- [24:31] things are looking and feeling is that
- [24:33] this feels more like a consumer thing
- [24:35] that I'm looking at because it's a phone
- [24:37] with a single person on it,
- [24:39] >> but the messaging is is positioning in a
- [24:42] different way. It's saying, "No, this is
- [24:45] >> um for large call centers." And so if if
- [24:48] you want me to think about large call
- [24:49] centers, show me seven of those phones
- [24:51] with a bunch of different people on it.
- [24:53] Now I'm thinking about multiple things
- [24:54] going on instead of one.
- [24:56] >> Yeah.
- [24:57] Okay. So,
- [24:59] normally when when we take a look at
- [25:01] voice AI sites, there's like a play
- [25:03] button or like something to start a
- [25:06] conversation to have a conversation with
- [25:07] it. Click to answer seems to be a thing,
- [25:11] but it was not obvious to me that that's
- [25:12] what I should click on to actually try
- [25:14] this out. So, let's see what happens if
- [25:16] I click this.
- [25:17] >> Hello, this is Alex from Leaping AI. Who
- [25:19] am I speaking to?
- [25:20] >> Hey, Alex, this is Aaron.
- [25:24] >> Hey, Aaron. Nice to meet you. So, what's
- [25:26] got you curious about AI and phone calls
- [25:28] today? Are you folks at your company
- [25:30] looking to automate some of those
- [25:31] endless ringing phones?
- [25:33] >> Yeah, we have a call center. It's really
- [25:35] complex. Uh, I was wondering if you
- [25:37] could help me out.
- [25:39] >> Absolutely, Aaron. Complex call centers
- [25:41] are my favorite puzzle.
- [25:42] >> Oh, I forgot to mention it's actually
- [25:44] overseas also.
- [25:47] >> No worries, Aaron. When you say over
- [25:49] some piece, do you mean your call center
- [25:52] handles both phone and chat or something
- [25:54] else? Oh, no. I actually said overseas.
- [25:58] >> Ah, got it. Overseas. Thanks for
- [26:00] clarifying, Aaron. Are your call center
- [26:02] agents based internationally or are your
- [26:04] customers mostly overseas? What's the
- [26:05] biggest headache you're running into
- [26:07] right now?
- [26:07] >> Trying to coordinate with time zones is
- [26:09] a big problem.
- [26:12] >> Oh, time zones. The ultimate boss level.
- [26:14] That can be a real pain.
- [26:15] >> It's pretty good.
- [26:16] >> Yeah.
- [26:17] >> I mean, you're trying to give it a hard
- [26:19] time, but uh, you know, good job.
- [26:21] >> Yeah, it did well. It rolled with the
- [26:23] punches. um it understood most of of
- [26:25] what I was saying there. I guess my
- [26:26] biggest take away from the demo is like
- [26:28] if I was actually a potential customer,
- [26:30] it wasn't driving me to like the
- [26:33] problems of that customer. It was just
- [26:35] kind of like, oh, tell me about like
- [26:37] calls, you know, it should be like, tell
- [26:39] me about your call center, something
- [26:40] like that.
- [26:41] >> I do think that we were just uh talking
- [26:43] about animation. I I think this is an an
- [26:46] an example of animations done quite
- [26:48] well. Um, so the pulsing background
- [26:50] here, click to answer. It's pretty clear
- [26:53] that you know something here you want,
- [26:55] they want the user uh want to guide the
- [26:58] user to to click on that click to answer
- [27:00] button. Yeah.
- [27:00] >> And as you scroll. Okay. Wow. Okay. This
- [27:03] is uh immersive. Very cool.
- [27:07] >> It just keeps getting bigger and bigger
- [27:09] >> and more purple.
- [27:12] >> This is interesting. Like it takes over
- [27:13] the screen and they get rid of the
- [27:14] navbar, but they keep the like enter
- [27:17] your email.
- [27:17] >> Yep. up there that call to action.
- [27:20] >> Yeah, I think the interactions and the
- [27:21] animations here are really immersive,
- [27:23] trying to uh pull me in and I'm happy to
- [27:27] see that they're showing some more
- [27:28] agents here um
- [27:30] >> instead of it just being sort of a
- [27:32] single player feel.
- [27:33] >> Yeah. Trusted by industry leaders, uh
- [27:37] university call center automating 50% of
- [27:40] calls. Okay, so some customer social
- [27:43] proof here. Got enterprisegrade security
- [27:45] again which is important because they
- [27:47] were very clear upfront that they're
- [27:49] going after enterprises.
- [27:50] >> Yep.
- [27:51] >> Uh data inhouse robust guard rails unit
- [27:53] tests expert experimentation.
- [27:56] Uh schedule a free consultation
- [27:59] provide details in here.
- [28:02] Um not sure what this is.
- [28:05] Yeah. Again this kind of comes back to
- [28:07] your like makes me think it happens on
- [28:09] an iPhone rather than a call center. I
- [28:10] imagine like software being run in
- [28:12] distributed systems.
- [28:14] >> Yep.
- [28:14] >> Um so that feels a little disconnected.
- [28:17] More FAQs.
- [28:19] And then we got a little hidden footer
- [28:21] at the bottom. Very cool.
- [28:24] >> Yeah. I think there's a lot of details
- [28:26] uh interaction wise and animation wise
- [28:28] that that I that I think are um of high
- [28:31] quality that like seem to be
- [28:34] >> Yeah. It's got a pretty distinct
- [28:36] aesthetic going for uh for it. So, the
- [28:39] aesthetics I think are are feel
- [28:41] polished. I think the interactions are
- [28:43] are helpful, not in the way. I think the
- [28:45] animations are pretty awesome.
- [28:48] >> I think my main piece of feedback, if I
- [28:51] have to look at this page top to bottom,
- [28:52] is that it's clearly trying to position
- [28:54] itself as an enterprise large scale team
- [28:57] solution.
- [28:58] >> Y,
- [28:58] >> but nothing about that aesthetic really
- [29:01] drives that home for me.
- [29:02] >> Mh. So, I would try to figure out how to
- [29:05] align that a bit better with what do
- [29:08] enterprises actually need and and what
- [29:10] are some of the use cases that you're
- [29:11] trying to solve. I think that demo at
- [29:13] the top is pretty awesome.
- [29:14] >> Y
- [29:15] >> uh in the fact that it works and it got
- [29:17] us to try the product uh without a
- [29:20] signup field and and and kind of like in
- [29:22] the browser.
- [29:22] >> Yeah.
- [29:23] >> But it it's a bit disconnected from okay
- [29:27] now what would happen next if I am an
- [29:30] enterprise and I want to try this out.
- [29:31] >> Yeah. I think um I don't know, maybe
- [29:33] this is stereotypical and not true. U
- [29:36] but I if he had a headset on, you know,
- [29:39] it makes me think like he's at a call
- [29:41] center and and I'm going to demo that.
- [29:42] And even this here, click to answer. I
- [29:45] found it because I was looking for
- [29:47] something like this. I was looking for a
- [29:48] play button or or something like that to
- [29:50] have a conversation or a phone button
- [29:52] which was here. But um if this kind of
- [29:54] had like a pulsing purple glow, you
- [29:58] know, that just kind of told me like
- [29:59] click on this. this is the next thing
- [30:01] that we want you to do. Um, I think it's
- [30:03] more likely that that would be clicked
- [30:04] as well. Overall, like I think this is
- [30:06] great. I I think you're right. It's a
- [30:08] great example of animations adding value
- [30:10] by helping communicate functionality and
- [30:12] what the product actually does, which is
- [30:14] really great. And overall, it looks
- [30:15] modern and professional.
- [30:17] >> Yeah, I agree. Awesome.
- [30:18] >> Well done, guys.
- [30:19] >> Next up, we got the hog.
- [30:22] >> Whoa, the hog.
- [30:24] >> It's a lot going on here. Scale your
- [30:25] growth. The hog gives you gas. Growth as
- [30:28] a service. Unlock the power of full
- [30:31] sales and marketing team with AI agents
- [30:33] that research, plan, and execute your
- [30:34] GTM strategies. Save hundreds of hours
- [30:37] of work.
- [30:39] >> All right.
- [30:40] >> All right. I mean, it definitely leaves
- [30:42] an impression. The hog.
- [30:44] >> Yeah. I think one of the biggest things,
- [30:46] so yeah, obviously in the messaging,
- [30:47] right, the hog gives you gas. Like
- [30:49] they're
- [30:49] >> they're going for it.
- [30:51] >> Um, the first thing that I notice is the
- [30:53] font. There's a lot of, you know,
- [30:58] swirly elements here that make it harder
- [31:00] to read.
- [31:00] >> Yep.
- [31:01] >> And one thing that stood out to me here,
- [31:02] too, and and and it looks like it's
- [31:03] right. There's two spaces in between the
- [31:05] hog and gives.
- [31:07] >> Maybe they did that on purpose to create
- [31:10] some more. Isn't that also between scale
- [31:12] and your is that one or two?
- [31:13] >> Yeah, that's why it makes me think
- [31:15] there's an error here.
- [31:16] >> Yeah.
- [31:16] >> And let's see. Yeah, this one is one.
- [31:18] This one is one. This one is two. Yeah,
- [31:22] >> spacing uh can be improved.
- [31:25] >> That's the that's the designer curse
- [31:26] right there. Like a detail like that
- [31:28] that feels very minor, but it leads to
- [31:30] that impression of like something is off
- [31:32] here. Something is not quite right, even
- [31:33] though it's so minor. Um same thing
- [31:35] here. Actually, the period has a space
- [31:38] from the S to the period. And so when I
- [31:42] see this, my takeaway is whoever is
- [31:44] behind this is not detail oriented.
- [31:46] >> Yeah. But overall, I would say like the
- [31:48] wrapping like this needs a max width
- [31:50] that doesn't exceed this. So it starts
- [31:53] here and it ends there. Ideally, it
- [31:55] starts here,
- [31:56] >> ends there. And yeah,
- [31:57] >> right. So there's a funnel, right, going
- [31:58] down to the button.
- [32:00] >> Yeah.
- [32:00] >> But the thing that most mostly stands
- [32:02] out to me, I mean, obviously the name,
- [32:04] but then they went for some sort of like
- [32:06] emoji as the logo. I don't know what to
- [32:08] make of that. Like I don't I don't think
- [32:10] that's a very good logo. uh naming wise,
- [32:15] you really want to associate a hog with
- [32:18] my growth service. I I don't know, maybe
- [32:21] that's a reference that I don't
- [32:22] understand. Maybe that's something
- [32:23] cultural does.
- [32:24] >> Yeah. So, this is not obvious from here,
- [32:26] but um I saw this company's launch
- [32:28] recently. Okay.
- [32:29] >> And I believe that hog stands for head
- [32:31] of growth.
- [32:32] >> Oo, okay.
- [32:34] >> Which maybe they should say that, right?
- [32:36] >> I mean, I didn't did Did you know that?
- [32:37] >> I I would not have known that had I not
- [32:39] seen that. Yeah. I'm glad to hear that
- [32:41] it's not me.
- [32:41] >> Yeah. Thank you.
- [32:43] >> Okay. So, head of growth uh is that's
- [32:45] the hog and then
- [32:47] >> and he gives you gas which is he gives
- [32:49] you growth as a surface.
- [32:50] >> Okay.
- [32:50] >> Okay. So, a couple of things that stand
- [32:52] out to me. One, the font choices seem
- [32:54] random. Yeah.
- [32:55] >> Um you know, you've got this, you know,
- [32:57] script kind of thing going on up here.
- [33:00] And then down here, it's just kind of,
- [33:01] you know, generic like Helvetica or
- [33:03] something. Um and then this is weird up
- [33:08] here. log in and request a demo. It
- [33:10] looks like um a toggle button, but I
- [33:13] assume they're both individual buttons,
- [33:15] which is strange.
- [33:18] Um and then I can't tell what's
- [33:20] happening here. There's like a bunch of
- [33:22] icons going into the hog and then
- [33:26] paid digital marketing and LinkedIn
- [33:28] outreach is coming out. That doesn't
- [33:29] make sense to me.
- [33:30] >> Yeah, I know. This is uh it's it's a lot
- [33:33] to take in. It's not obvious to me what
- [33:35] the workflow is that we're trying to
- [33:38] sell.
- [33:39] >> Yeah. And what do they do? I guess like
- [33:41] they research, plan, and execute GTM
- [33:43] strategies. And then there's these
- [33:45] things. And these are moving kind of
- [33:46] fast. So like it's hard for me to read
- [33:48] them all. Okay. Introducing The Hog, the
- [33:50] all-in-one marketing, and sales tool.
- [33:52] One platform for research, planning,
- [33:54] execution. Again, this is like so wide.
- [33:56] It feels exhausting to have to like read
- [33:58] all the way across this sentence. The
- [34:00] hog.ai AI tracks competitors, listens
- [34:02] across social, ranks channels by ROI,
- [34:04] and writes the blogs and posts that fuel
- [34:06] thought leadership and brand growth.
- [34:08] >> Okay, I mean, that is clear. And there's
- [34:10] a video.
- [34:11] >> Yeah, interestingly, this is our first
- [34:12] video, so let's check this out.
- [34:14] >> I love truffles,
- [34:16] but here's the problem. They're really
- [34:18] expensive and incredibly hard to find.
- [34:22] This is Hanzo. He's a truffle pig.
- [34:24] >> Yay.
- [34:26] >> His job to help me find my precious
- [34:28] truffles. Here's the thing. We know that
- [34:30] finding your customers can be just as
- [34:33] hard.
- [34:35] And this is why we created the hog.
- [34:39] It's like the Google maps for customer
- [34:41] acquisition.
- [34:41] >> We help you uncover every possible route
- [34:43] and highlight the most optimized path to
- [34:45] help you reach your customers.
- [34:46] >> The future of go to market is not that.
- [34:49] >> This is like a twominute video.
- [34:51] >> Okay. Hey, at least they understand the
- [34:53] hog and and and why that's a good
- [34:55] reference. It could work.
- [34:58] helps find the truffle the customers.
- [35:00] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We definitely
- [35:02] need to get some max width. Uh yeah. Set
- [35:04] up.
- [35:04] >> There's a daily action center here.
- [35:06] Okay. So, now we're starting to see the
- [35:07] product. This is the first time we've
- [35:10] seen this here. I can't quite tell
- [35:12] what's going on. I'm in the hog. I can
- [35:16] generate a reply
- [35:18] um
- [35:21] to something on LinkedIn, I guess. So, I
- [35:24] guess it just centralizes a lot of your
- [35:26] social interactions and customer
- [35:28] outreach on those platforms, maybe.
- [35:29] >> Yeah,
- [35:30] >> if that's right. Oh, and then there's an
- [35:31] agent center. It's a control room. Okay.
- [35:35] Um,
- [35:37] I can't quite tell what's going on here.
- [35:38] There's a lot of text and stuff.
- [35:40] >> This is a this is a long landing page. I
- [35:43] think you're you're about a third in.
- [35:46] >> Okay, let's speed up. No, not not saying
- [35:48] that, but like that's that's typically
- [35:50] if you have that much to to to to
- [35:53] communicate. Um
- [35:55] >> I wonder if I click on pricing if it
- [35:57] just jumps me. Yeah, it jumps me down on
- [35:58] the page.
- [36:00] >> Okay.
- [36:00] >> Okay, we're halfway. Yeah.
- [36:01] >> Get real measurable results,
- [36:04] ROI, blah blah blah. Here's some people.
- [36:06] Uh this doesn't say like what company
- [36:09] they're from, so it seems sort of made
- [36:10] up. It's just like this guy's a head of
- [36:12] growth and this guy's a VP of marketing,
- [36:14] but like where have we heard of their
- [36:15] company? Are they good? Did you just
- [36:17] make this up? Why is every word
- [36:19] capitalized here? Um, it makes me think
- [36:22] like humans don't write like that. Yeah.
- [36:24] >> And so this feels like it's actually not
- [36:25] a direct quote. This one too. The
- [36:27] chances that both of these people
- [36:29] actually write by capitalizing the first
- [36:31] word of every sentence, I don't believe
- [36:33] and therefore I don't believe these are
- [36:35] real quotes as a result.
- [36:36] >> And that makes you question the numbers
- [36:38] that are uh being written down as well.
- [36:40] >> Yeah.
- [36:41] >> Yeah. Exactly. is kind of to your point
- [36:43] earlier about it's the little things
- [36:44] that kind of subconsciously add up and
- [36:46] tell you a story about what's really
- [36:48] going on here. Yeah. Our features unlock
- [36:50] the power of entire sales and marketing
- [36:51] team. Okay. Find my customers. All
- [36:53] right. So, we're just going through a
- [36:54] bunch of screenshots here and then
- [36:56] they've got the pricing thing.
- [36:59] >> But is this a SAS product or is it more
- [37:02] like a service? Because at at the top
- [37:04] they say it's a service.
- [37:06] >> Yeah, they said growth as a service I
- [37:08] guess. Okay. I think they were trying to
- [37:10] play on SAS, you know. I think that's
- [37:13] what they're trying to do. But you're
- [37:14] right. If you just took it as like the
- [37:15] service thing, then you would think
- [37:17] maybe it's like humans come and help you
- [37:19] with this.
- [37:19] >> Like some agency that I paid 200 bucks a
- [37:21] month,
- [37:22] >> right?
- [37:22] >> Yeah.
- [37:23] >> Interestingly, they use the same widget
- [37:25] here for the login and request demo, but
- [37:27] this one actually feels like it's a
- [37:29] toggle to go between monthly and yearly.
- [37:32] >> Yeah.
- [37:32] >> Um Okay. And if I click login. Yeah.
- [37:35] >> So, this one actually takes me to a
- [37:36] login page. So the problem with this is
- [37:40] totally different interaction between
- [37:42] the same widget here on the same page,
- [37:44] right?
- [37:45] >> Yeah, that's very confusing.
- [37:48] >> The hog essentials are always included.
- [37:51] So what our clients say again, no
- [37:54] company name, business analyst, product
- [37:57] designer, every word is capitalized,
- [38:00] sales executive.
- [38:02] Um, put the names in there to make it
- [38:04] more real. The more specific the better.
- [38:08] Okay. And then come work with us.
- [38:11] Custom dashboard. Yeah. Okay. So,
- [38:13] there's just a lot of stuff here like
- [38:14] all on one page, right?
- [38:16] >> Yeah. Yeah. There's there's there's uh
- [38:17] probably way too much going on from the
- [38:19] overall style, I would say, to to the
- [38:21] typography, the layout. It's too much.
- [38:24] >> Yeah. It's interesting because I think
- [38:25] sometimes founders feel like we got to
- [38:27] put everything in there to tell people
- [38:28] all the things, but really what ends up
- [38:31] happening is you create a lot of noise
- [38:32] that distracts from like the core thing
- [38:34] you really want somebody to take away.
- [38:36] >> Yeah. I mean, for me, this was pretty
- [38:37] overwhelming. Uh just to piece together
- [38:40] the name, what's going on, is it the
- [38:42] service, is it a product, what am I
- [38:44] buying, what's the problem it solves,
- [38:47] and then like you're pointing out, like
- [38:49] all the tiny little details adds to a
- [38:51] feeling of being a bit overwhelmed. So,
- [38:52] it seems like our advice here is
- [38:55] simplify.
- [38:55] >> Yeah.
- [38:56] >> Pair down in terms of both content and
- [38:59] the styles that are on the page. This, I
- [39:01] don't think, was helpful.
- [39:02] >> No.
- [39:03] >> Uh, this animation. It's okay to have
- [39:05] multiple pages on a website.
- [39:07] >> It's okay.
- [39:07] >> You can put the about stuff on a
- [39:09] separate page. You can put pricing on a
- [39:10] separate page.
- [39:11] >> I do think this kind of like it feels at
- [39:13] the first step is like I I don't really
- [39:15] know what this is.
- [39:16] >> So, I think a really good exercise for
- [39:18] this team to do is to just like put this
- [39:20] page to the side. Mhm.
- [39:22] >> Make a new one and the only thing that
- [39:24] you're allowed to put on there is things
- [39:27] that help me understand what it is
- [39:29] >> and then test that on 20 people that
- [39:31] don't know what it is. Yeah.
- [39:32] >> And ask them, yep,
- [39:33] >> what do you think this is? From there,
- [39:34] you can expand and turn it into a more
- [39:36] full landing page. But it's a good
- [39:37] exercise.
- [39:38] >> Well, product seems really cool. A lot
- [39:39] of founders would want to use this. Get
- [39:41] some growth.
- [39:42] >> For sure.
- [39:42] >> For a a small monthly fee, right?
- [39:44] >> Yeah. I mean, this is everyone's dream.
- [39:45] I just like subscribe here and my
- [39:48] company goes Yeah. up and to the right.
- [39:50] >> Yep. Awesome. Nice job, the hog. That
- [39:53] does it for us.
- [39:53] >> All right.
- [39:54] >> Thank you. Th This was incredible. Great
- [39:56] feedback and and love uh seeing the
- [39:58] types of things that you hone in on and
- [40:00] that you're looking for when you
- [40:01] evaluate uh sites and products.
- [40:03] >> Cool. Yeah, thanks for having me. I
- [40:04] mean, I I enjoyed this a lot. If any of
- [40:06] these startups need help, guy at
- [40:08] framer.com gladly set you up with an
- [40:10] expert to help with some of the details.
- [40:12] >> Awesome. Well, thank you, Yorn, for
- [40:13] joining and thank you all for watching
- [40:15] another episode of Design Review. We'll
- [40:17] see you on the next one.
