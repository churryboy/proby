## Key insight / summary

- **20x 컴퍼니 개념**: AI 자동화를 통해 직원 한 명이 20배의 성과를 내는 스타트업들이 등장하고 있음 (Anthropic의 Claude 팀이 실제로 AI를 활용해 제품을 개발하는 사례)
- **전면적 내부 자동화**: 성공하는 스타트업들은 1-2개 기능만 자동화하는 것이 아니라 코드, 고객지원, 마케팅, 영업, 채용, QA 등 모든 내부 기능을 자동화
- **세 가지 자동화 접근법**: ①AI 팀메이트 구축(Giga ML의 Atlas), ②통합 정보 허브 구축(Legion Health), ③직원별 맞춤 에이전트 구축(Phase Shift)
- **소수정예 팀의 우위**: 자동화를 통해 4-5명 팀이 100명 규모 경쟁사를 이기는 사례들이 실제로 발생 (GigaML vs 기존 업체들)
- **채용 지연 효과**: AI 자동화로 인해 영업/운영 직원 채용을 훨씬 늦게까지 미룰 수 있어 비용 절감과 문화 유지에 도움
- **실무자 워크플로우 최적화**: Phase Shift처럼 직원들의 수동 작업을 문서화하고 각각에 맞는 AI 에이전트를 구축하는 방식
- **복합적 접근의 효과**: 세 가지 방법을 동시에 활용하는 기업들이 가장 큰 성장률을 달성하고 있음

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **Proby 자체도 20x 컴퍼니가 되어야 함**: 사용자 리서치 플랫폼을 만드는 과정에서도 내부 업무를 AI로 자동화해야 함 → 고객지원, 영업, 마케팅, 제품개발 프로세스에 AI 에이전트를 도입하여 소수정예 팀으로 큰 성과 창출

- **고객사의 20x 변신을 돕는 포지셔닝**: 단순한 "AI 설문조사 도구"가 아니라 "리서치팀을 20x 팀으로 만들어주는 플랫폼"으로 포지셔닝 → 유니콘/엔터프라이즈 타겟 세그먼트에게 "적은 리서처로 더 많은 인사이트를 얻을 수 있다"는 가치 전달

- **리서치 워크플로우 전체 자동화**: 현재 AI 모더레이션에 집중하고 있지만, 리크루팅-설문설계-분석-보고서작성까지 전 과정을 자동화하는 통합 플랫폼으로 확장 → McKinsey 문서의 "end-to-end platform" 방향성과 일치

- **고객별 맞춤 에이전트 제공**: Phase Shift처럼 각 리서처의 작업 패턴을 학습하여 개인화된 AI 어시스턴트 제공 → 스타트업 PM/PD와 엔터프라이즈 리서처의 서로 다른 워크플로우에 맞는 맞춤형 기능 개발

- **레퍼런스 케이스 구축 전략**: GigaML이 DoorDash를 확보한 것처럼, Proby도 대형 고객사에서 "기존 20배 규모 리서치팀과 경쟁해서 이긴" 사례를 만들어야 함 → 유니콘 beachhead 전략의 중요성 재확인

- **채용 지연 가치 제안**: "리서치팀 확장 없이 4배 성장"한 Legion Health처럼, Proby 고객사들도 리서처 추가 채용 없이 리서치 볼륨을 늘릴 수 있다는 ROI 스토리 개발 → 비용 절감뿐만 아니라 팀 관리 복잡성 감소 가치까지 어필

- **AI 네이티브 인터페이스 설계**: Legion Health의 통합 대시보드처럼, 여러 데이터 소스(과거 리서치, 고객 정보, 시장 데이터)를 한 곳에서 볼 수 있는 "single source of truth" 구축 → 리서처들이 맥락을 빠르게 파악하고 의사결정할 수 있는 환경 제공

- [00:00] If you haven't tried Claude Code in the
- [00:02] last month, it's time to give it another
- [00:04] shot. And if you have, you know what I'm
- [00:06] talking about. It feels [music] like AGI
- [00:08] is here. One of Anthropic's own
- [00:10] engineers writes, "Claude wrote Claude
- [00:14] Co-work. Us humans meet in person to
- [00:16] discuss foundational architecture and
- [00:18] product decisions. But all of us devs
- [00:21] manage anywhere between three and eight
- [00:24] clawed instances, implementing features,
- [00:26] fixing bugs, or researching potential
- [00:29] solutions. Think about what that means.
- [00:32] The team developing one of the most
- [00:34] sophisticated AI products in the world,
- [00:37] something many of you probably use every
- [00:39] day, is using this AI internally to
- [00:43] improve their product. I think this
- [00:45] points to a fundamental shift in how
- [00:47] startups operate. Right now, the best
- [00:50] teams aren't automating one or two
- [00:53] internal functions. They're automating
- [00:55] all of them. Often they're tiny teams
- [00:58] able to beat huge incumbents thanks to
- [01:01] internal automation. Their leanness is
- [01:04] their superpower. I've been calling
- [01:05] these startups 20x companies.
- [01:14] Several years ago, my friend Parker
- [01:16] Conrad, founder of Ripling and Zenits,
- [01:19] coined the term compound startup to
- [01:22] describe companies that build multiple
- [01:24] integrated products in parallel rather
- [01:27] than focusing narrowly on one thing.
- [01:30] >> The theory of like the compound software
- [01:32] business is that there's this island of
- [01:35] product market fit that's kind of over
- [01:37] the edge of the horizon line that's sort
- [01:40] of harder to get to. But if you can
- [01:42] build, you know, multiple parallel
- [01:45] applications at once, you can get there
- [01:48] and and it actually ends up being a much
- [01:50] more powerful type of product market fit
- [01:52] that's much harder to displace at that
- [01:54] point.
- [01:55] >> The 20X company could be an evolution of
- [01:58] Parker's idea, but applied to internal
- [02:01] automation. Instead of just narrowly
- [02:04] automating a few things like writing
- [02:06] code or handling customer support,
- [02:09] [music] 20X companies build automations
- [02:11] across all internal features, code,
- [02:14] support, marketing, sales, hiring, QA,
- [02:18] and more. [music]
- [02:19] This makes each of their employees
- [02:21] orders of magnitude more powerful than
- [02:23] they would be otherwise. It also allows
- [02:25] them to postpone hiring additional sales
- [02:28] and ops staff for much longer, keeping
- [02:30] payroll down and culture from drifting.
- [02:33] The phrase 20x company was actually
- [02:35] coined by the founders of Giga ML, which
- [02:37] builds voice-based [music]
- [02:39] customer service agents for enterprise
- [02:42] to describe how they managed to close
- [02:44] Door Dash as a customer going up against
- [02:47] incumbents that were literally 20x as
- [02:50] large. When we got Doash as a customer,
- [02:52] we were approximately like four to five
- [02:54] engineers going against players who had
- [02:56] like 100x engineers. So we kind of like
- [02:58] coined the term like hey we are a 20x
- [03:00] company because we are able to beat
- [03:02] these much bigger players who are like
- [03:04] 20x us by having a better product and
- [03:07] better numbers.
- [03:08] >> Giga was able to close Door Dash and
- [03:10] several other Fortune 500 companies as
- [03:12] customers because of a powerful internal
- [03:15] agent they call Atlas. So Atlas can
- [03:19] basically do anything within the product
- [03:21] which you want to do. So it can use
- [03:23] browsers, it can edit the policies, it
- [03:25] can write code, it can do anything
- [03:27] within the product.
- [03:28] >> Atlas dramatically expands the range of
- [03:30] what each engineer can take on.
- [03:32] >> So let's say before Atlas, every
- [03:34] engineer can probably work on four to
- [03:35] five problems at once because they are
- [03:38] bottlenecked by all the boilerplate
- [03:39] stuff they have to do for the customers,
- [03:41] right? Customers have integrations, they
- [03:43] would have to probably work on that. Now
- [03:44] with AFD taking care of all the
- [03:46] boilerplate stuff, each engineer scope
- [03:48] is basically doubled or tripled because
- [03:52] they don't need to work on the boiler
- [03:54] plate code.
- [03:54] >> But Atlas doesn't just accelerate Giga's
- [03:57] engineers. It also acts as a full-time
- [04:00] AI employee that works in tandem with a
- [04:03] human FTE to service dozens of accounts.
- [04:07] >> Right now, we have only a single human
- [04:09] FTE within the company. as hard as it's
- [04:12] to believe because we have companies
- [04:14] like Door Dash using us. We are in
- [04:16] pilots with multiple Fortune 500s, 10
- [04:18] plus Fortune 500s where each of these
- [04:20] companies probably have volumes over
- [04:22] like 500,000 or a million calls a day.
- [04:24] It's only been possible because like we
- [04:26] have Atlas and this person can primarily
- [04:28] focus on just the customer
- [04:30] relationships, the ask by the customers,
- [04:33] taking customer requests and turning
- [04:35] them into feature requests and
- [04:36] everything.
- [04:36] >> Building an AI teammate is one approach.
- [04:39] Another is to build an AI integrated
- [04:42] source of truth that gives employees
- [04:44] instant context [music] across your
- [04:46] entire system. Legion Health, which is
- [04:48] building an AI native psychiatry
- [04:50] network, is one example of how to do
- [04:53] this. Legion built a custom internal
- [04:55] interface for their care operations team
- [04:58] that lets them pull patient history,
- [05:00] scheduling availability, insurance
- [05:02] codes, and a lot more. What we're
- [05:04] showing you right now is an interface
- [05:06] that a vast majority of our care
- [05:09] operations team uses in their day-to-day
- [05:13] work for anything that actually has not
- [05:15] been yet automated. And this includes
- [05:19] everything from, as Arthur's kind of
- [05:20] showing on his screen, digging into a
- [05:23] particular patient or many patients
- [05:24] backgrounds, trying to understand where
- [05:26] they're at in their journey, if they
- [05:28] need a new appointment to be
- [05:30] rescheduled, if they're having a
- [05:31] prescription issue, if they've sent us a
- [05:34] message that in traditional healthcare
- [05:36] might have otherwise gotten lost in the
- [05:38] sea of different communications that go
- [05:40] back and forth between so many different
- [05:42] people. All of that is at a fingertips
- [05:45] reach for every single member of our KO
- [05:48] ops.
- [05:48] >> This single source of truth interface
- [05:50] has let Legion keep its ops headcount
- [05:52] [music] flat even as it's dramatically
- [05:54] scaled revenue.
- [05:56] >> So we've grown 4x in the past year, but
- [05:58] we haven't hired uh a single net new
- [06:00] person. We've been able to 4x the number
- [06:02] of patients. We're seeing thousands of
- [06:03] patients a month. We have dozens of
- [06:05] providers, but we have one clinical
- [06:07] lead. We [music] have one patient
- [06:08] support person and we have one billing
- [06:10] person. And in a typical healthcare
- [06:12] company, those are all departments. You
- [06:13] know, those are call centers. [music]
- [06:15] Those are groups of people sitting
- [06:16] around desks doing a ton of things
- [06:18] manually. A third approach is actually
- [06:21] build custom agents for each employee
- [06:23] depending on their workflow and
- [06:25] preferences. Phase shift, which is
- [06:27] building agents to automate accounts
- [06:29] receivable, took this approach.
- [06:31] >> So phase shift right now is a 12person
- [06:33] team and we're going up against
- [06:35] companies that have been around since
- [06:36] 2006 that have hundreds of employees.
- [06:39] The key to us as a 12 person team moving
- [06:41] so fast is we bring AI into every
- [06:43] process that is manual and try to
- [06:45] automate as much as possible [music]
- [06:46] with AI agents.
- [06:47] >> One way phase shift does this is by
- [06:49] literally asking its employees to
- [06:51] document the manual tasks they do
- [06:53] [music] and then building custom agents
- [06:55] for them. So what we do is essentially
- [06:58] say what do you spend your time doing
- [07:01] throughout the day and we make them
- [07:02] document [music] that and then we build
- [07:04] quick AI agents
- [07:06] >> and this culture of relentless
- [07:07] automation has let phase shift delay
- [07:10] hiring for entire functions.
- [07:12] >> We've actually avoided hiring a [music]
- [07:13] design person at the company so far to
- [07:15] date we're about a 12 person company by
- [07:17] just leveraging magic patterns and our
- [07:19] engineering team uses that to build all
- [07:20] front-end designs.
- [07:21] >> These approaches aren't [music] mutually
- [07:23] exclusive. You can build AI teammates, a
- [07:26] unified source of truth, and custom
- [07:28] agents for each member of your team. The
- [07:32] companies that do this are staying lean
- [07:34] and setting record high growth rates.
- [07:37] This is the new way to build, and the
- [07:39] startups that figure it out first are
- [07:41] going to win.
