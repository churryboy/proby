## Key insight / summary

- **성장 정체 진단을 위한 4단계 프레임워크**: 1) 고객 이탈 분석 → 2) 가격/포지셔닝 검토 → 3) 채널 포화도 점검 → 4) 성장 필요성 재검토 순으로 체계적 접근
- **가격이 너무 낮은 경우가 많다**: 창업자들이 추측으로 가격을 정하고 변경하지 않아서, 특히 기업 고객에게는 저가격이 오히려 품질에 대한 의구심을 불러일으킴
- **고객 이탈의 심각성**: 발견→홈페이지→가격→구매까지의 험난한 여정을 통과한 고객이 떠나는 것은 제품 자체에 근본적 문제가 있음을 시사
- **채널 포화도 인식의 중요성**: 어떤 마케팅 채널이 포화되었고 어떤 채널이 여전히 기회가 있는지 정확히 파악해야 함
- **기능 추가만으로는 해결 안 됨**: 작은 기능 하나 추가하고 광고에만 의존하는 방식으로는 성장 정체를 돌파할 수 없음
- **"성장하지 않으면 죽는다"는 명제에 대한 의문**: 모든 상황에서 성장이 필수인지, 아니면 투자자들이 만든 압박인지 냉정하게 판단해야 함

## Key implications for Proby platform

- **Proby의 가격 전략 재검토 필요**: 현재 "5-10배 비용 절감"을 강조하고 있지만, 기업 고객에게는 너무 저렴한 가격이 오히려 품질 의구심을 불러일으킬 수 있음 → 유니콘/대기업 세그먼트에서는 가치 기반 프리미엄 가격 전략 고려
- **고객 이탈률을 핵심 지표로 모니터링**: 전략 문서에서 언급된 3개 타겟 세그먼트(스타트업 PM/PD, 유니콘 리서처, 대기업 리서처) 각각의 이탈률과 이탈 이유를 세밀하게 추적해야 함 → 세그먼트별 온보딩과 성공 메트릭 차별화
- **채널 포화도 기반의 GTM 전략 수립**: 전략 문서에서 부족했던 구체적인 고객 획득 채널별 포화도를 사전에 파악 → 초기에는 직접 영업(유니콘 타겟), 중기에는 파트너십(리서치 툴 연동), 후기에는 PLG(스타트업 대상) 순으로 채널 다변화
- **제품-시장 적합성 검증을 이탈률로 측정**: AI 모더레이션 품질이 인간 수준과 동등한지에 대한 가정을 고객 이탈률과 재구매율로 지속적으로 검증 → 품질 개선이 마케팅보다 우선순위
- **기능 중심이 아닌 채널 중심 성장 전략**: 새로운 AI 기능 개발보다는 검증된 채널에서의 실행력 강화에 집중 → 초기에는 소수 비치헤드 고객(유니콘 리서처)에서의 성공 사례 확보가 더 중요
- **성장 vs 수익성의 균형점 찾기**: 전략 문서에서 부족했던 재무 모델과 연결하여, 무조건적인 성장보다는 건강한 단위 경제학 달성 후 확장하는 전략 → CAC/LTV 비율이 건전해진 후 공격적 마케팅 투자

- [00:00] A lot of product teams, a lot of
- [00:01] founders build something, it starts to
- [00:02] show some success and then all of a
- [00:03] sudden it just stops growing.
- [00:05] >> There's a series of questions that I ask
- [00:07] to diagnose why is growth slowing. The
- [00:09] first question is, are customers
- [00:11] leaving? Think about the gauntlet they
- [00:12] went through to get to the product. How
- [00:14] do they even find out about me? That was
- [00:16] hard already and improbable. They didn't
- [00:18] just bounce off the homepage, which is
- [00:19] again improbable. And they got to the
- [00:20] pricing page that didn't scare them off.
- [00:22] They actually had the budget and bought
- [00:23] the stupid thing. And after all of that,
- [00:25] which clearly means they wanted it to
- [00:27] work, they're like, "No, buy what?"
- [00:30] Like, like just on an emotional level,
- [00:32] you got to go, "Wait a minute, that's
- [00:33] terrible."
- [00:34] >> Step two is pricing positioning.
- [00:36] >> Your prices are way too low because you
- [00:38] just guessed and you haven't changed
- [00:40] them. What often happens is you raise
- [00:41] prices and signups don't change. Just
- [00:43] think about a company with a,000
- [00:44] employees and 400 million in revenue or
- [00:46] whatever. If they see a product that's
- [00:48] $2 a month or even $100 a month, thought
- [00:50] is like, "That can't be good enough." We
- [00:52] position this conversation as how to
- [00:54] deal with stalled growth, but it's
- [00:56] actually just as useful for how do I
- [00:57] grow more?
- [00:58] >> Do you know right now which channels are
- [01:00] saturated and which aren't? You can't
- [01:01] just rely on marketing forever. Just
- [01:03] adding one little feature and then
- [01:04] hoping we can flog Adwords is not going
- [01:06] to work.
- [01:07] >> What comes next?
- [01:07] >> The last question is, do you need to
- [01:09] grow? We all have heard the phrase, if
- [01:11] you're not growing, you're dying. Is
- [01:12] that true or is that the kind of thing
- [01:14] that investors use to make founders try
- [01:16] to grow even when they shouldn't?
- [01:19] >> Today my guest is Jason Cohen. Jason is
- [01:21] a four-time founder, including two
- [01:23] unicorns, one being WP Engine. He's not
- [01:26] just an incredible builder and
- [01:28] entrepreneur. He's also an incredible
- [01:30] writer and share of product wisdom. He's
- [01:33] been sharing his advice online for over
- [01:34] 20 years now. I've been a huge fan of
- [01:37] Jason's from afar for so long, and it
- [01:39] was such a treat to have him on the
- [01:40] podcast. There are a million things we
- [01:43] could have talked about. I'm definitely
- [01:44] going to have him back. In this
- [01:45] conversation, we spent the entire time
- [01:47] talking about his very actionable and a
- [01:50] very helpful framework for what to do
- [01:52] when your product's growth stalls. I
- [01:54] found his way of looking at the problem
- [01:55] incredibly practical and real and
- [01:58] actionable. And if you're looking for
- [02:00] ideas for how to rekindle your product's
- [02:02] growth or just accelerate the growth of
- [02:04] your product, you're going to walk away
- [02:06] from this conversation with your mind
- [02:07] buzzing. Also, I'll add that after 20
- [02:10] years of blogging online, Jason is about
- [02:12] to publish his very first real book.
- [02:15] It's called Hidden Multipliers. You can
- [02:16] now pre-order it online at hidden
- [02:18] multipliers.com.
- [02:20] I am going to grab a bunch. I bet after
- [02:22] listening to this conversation, you will
- [02:24] too. If you enjoy this podcast, don't

- [02:53] our sponsors. This episode is brought to
- [02:55] you by Tene Webb, the company that
- [02:58] pioneered AI website building before
- [03:00] ChatgPT. In the last 3 years, over 2
- [03:03] million websites have been generated
- [03:04] with Tenweb's VIP coding platform.
- [03:06] Tenweb's VIP coding platform is a
- [03:08] powerful way to build websites. Think of
- [03:10] it as lovable for WordPress front end
- [03:13] and backend. Users can build any website
- [03:16] at any complexity. E-commerce
- [03:18] portfolios, information websites, blogs,
- [03:21] and it comes with the WordPress admin
- [03:23] panel and thousands of readytouse
- [03:25] plugins. Tenweb also offers website
- [03:27] generation as an API as a service for
- [03:30] SAS companies, marketplaces, hosting
- [03:32] providers, MSPs, and agencies. SAS
- [03:35] companies can embed it via API so that
- [03:37] users can launch AI generated sites
- [03:39] directly inside of their platform
- [03:41] connected to their own data. Agencies
- [03:43] and MSPs can get a white label dashboard
- [03:46] to manage clients and resell under their
- [03:48] brand. Hosting providers can self-host
- [03:50] the API builder on their own
- [03:52] infrastructure. Check it out at

- [04:08] Vipcoding platform as an API.
- [04:10] This episode is brought to you by
- [04:12] Stella, the customer research platform
- [04:14] built for the AI era. Here's the truth
- [04:17] about user research. It's never been
- [04:19] more important or more painful. Teams
- [04:22] want to understand why customers do what
- [04:23] they do. But recruiting users, running
- [04:26] interviews, and analyzing insights takes
- [04:28] weeks. By the time the results are in,
- [04:30] the moment to act has passed. Strella
- [04:33] changes that. It's the first platform
- [04:35] that uses AI to run and analyze in-depth
- [04:37] interviews automatically, bringing fast
- [04:39] and continuous user research to every
- [04:41] team. Strella's AI moderator asks real
- [04:44] follow-up questions, probing deeper when
- [04:47] answers are vague, and services patterns
- [04:49] across hundreds of conversations, all in
- [04:51] a few hours, not weeks. Product design
- [04:54] and research teams at companies like
- [04:55] Amazon and Dualingo are already using
- [04:58] Stella for Figma prototype testing,
- [05:00] concept validation, and customer journey
- [05:02] research, getting insights overnight
- [05:04] instead of waiting for the next sprint.
- [05:06] If your team wants to understand
- [05:08] customers at the speed you ship
- [05:09] products, try Strella. Run your next
- [05:12] study at strea.io/enny.
- [05:15] That's str.io/lenny.
- [05:22] Jason, thank you so much for being here
- [05:24] and welcome to the podcast.
- [05:26] >> Thank you. It's an honor to be here.
- [05:27] >> It's an honor to have you here. I have
- [05:29] wanted to get you on this podcast for so
- [05:32] long. You are both an incredible builder
- [05:34] and a founder and you are such a great
- [05:38] communicator. You have been writing at
- [05:40] uh a smartbear.com which I want to get
- [05:42] the backstory on for so long. How long
- [05:45] have you been writing uh there by the
- [05:46] way?
- [05:47] >> Almost 20 years. I started when blogging
- [05:49] was cool and I'm still I'm waiting for
- [05:51] blogging to come back and be cool again
- [05:53] but it's not yet.
- [05:54] >> I think it is cool when newsletters are
- [05:56] cool now. Yeah,
- [05:57] >> newsletters are cool.
- [05:58] >> I don't know if you saw Twitter now is
- [05:59] encouraging long form writing. There's
- [06:00] like this articles feature. So I think
- [06:02] it's cool. I think you've survived the
- [06:04] >> rough. Okay.
- [06:06] >> Uh I was also talking to Gemini trying
- [06:08] to figure out how many posts you've
- [06:09] written. I was like count the number of
- [06:10] blog posts on a smartbear.com. How many
- [06:12] do you have a sense of how many things
- [06:13] you've written on there?
- [06:14] >> Yeah, it's not that many. Uh it's
- [06:16] something like maybeund well I would say
- [06:19] between 150 and 200 that I'm proud of
- [06:21] and probably about 300 350 and that's it
- [06:24] over you know about 18 years and that's
- [06:26] because I only write uh in depth some
- [06:29] are long not all are long but none are
- [06:30] short I guess and um I I've always had a
- [06:34] rule even though you're supposed to
- [06:35] write really regularly and not just for
- [06:37] algorithms but they used to say again
- [06:39] back in the as where I started oh yeah
- [06:42] it needs to be like really regular so
- [06:43] people know when to expect your thing
- [06:45] and they they plug it into their day and
- [06:47] all this. So, it's always been true that
- [06:48] you should be that you should be regular
- [06:51] and I never was because my attitude was
- [06:53] was always I will only put out stuff if
- [06:55] if it's the best that I can do. It's up
- [06:58] to the reader to decide if it's good or
- [07:00] useful. Um, and if so, if I don't have
- [07:02] that, I'm just not going to publish.
- [07:04] That's the way it is. And so, there's
- [07:06] years where I've published once or twice
- [07:08] only the whole year. Maybe I was busy or
- [07:10] didn't have the energy. other years were
- [07:12] yeah I posted you know 40 times or
- [07:13] something but even then it's only that
- [07:15] because I can't I can't do something of
- [07:17] that magnitude and also found unicorns
- [07:19] which I did during that same time and
- [07:21] run them you know I can't do that all at
- [07:23] the same time um and produce a lot so
- [07:26] it's fewer and hopefully better but
- [07:28] that's in the eye of the reader of
- [07:29] course
- [07:29] >> I like when you say I've I've done 300
- [07:31] not too many
- [07:32] >> well not for 18 years that right like
- [07:34] over that time you
- [07:34] >> but I think this actually this is where
- [07:36] I was going to go but I think this is a
- [07:37] really important lesson I've also
- [07:38] learned I always used to tell people the
- [07:40] the key to being successful writing
- [07:43] stuff online and just content in general
- [07:45] is quality and consistency. But I've
- [07:47] just more and more realized quality is
- [07:49] actually the only thing that matters and
- [07:51] the consistency doesn't matter. So the
- [07:54] only difference is like the more rarely
- [07:56] you write the more awesome it has to be.
- [07:58] It is a lot of pressure. I feel that and
- [08:01] then I tell myself you that will just
- [08:03] prevent you from writing anything and
- [08:05] that's not good. So yeah, you tend to
- [08:08] want every thing you make to be the best
- [08:10] thing you've ever made. And on the one
- [08:12] hand, I want to hold on to that because
- [08:14] it its motivation to be good and not to
- [08:16] let the bar slip. On the other hand, it
- [08:19] can go into paralysis, which is
- [08:20] obviously bad. So yeah, I still struggle
- [08:24] with that, but I think that's that is
- [08:25] the tension.
- [08:26] >> Okay, so with 300ish posts, 200 you're
- [08:29] proud of, there are so many directions
- [08:32] we can go. There's a few that I've
- [08:33] picked that I want to spend most of our
- [08:35] time on. The first is you have a really
- [08:38] pragmatic way of approaching uh growth
- [08:41] stalling. And the reason I want to spend
- [08:43] time here is because a lot of product
- [08:45] teams, a lot of founders build
- [08:46] something, it starts to show some
- [08:48] success there. It's it's going, it's
- [08:50] growing, and then all a sudden it just
- [08:51] stops growing. And I think that's one of
- [08:53] the most painful things to go through.
- [08:54] And there's never I've never come across
- [08:56] a a way to think about how do I solve
- [08:58] this because I think a lot of people are
- [09:00] just like, okay, I guess that is not
- [09:02] working. Let's move on to something
- [09:03] else. you have a very specific way of
- [09:05] approaching this problem and I want to I
- [09:07] want to read actually a quote from Will
- [09:09] Smith and this is something that has
- [09:10] stuck with me ever since I read it
- [09:13] because it's so true. So in his
- [09:15] biography he has this line. People ask
- [09:18] him what's it like to be famous and his
- [09:19] answer is becoming famous is amazing.
- [09:23] Being famous is a mixed bag. Losing fame
- [09:26] is miserable.
- [09:29] >> That's funny. So first of all, I think a
- [09:31] lot of people are experiencing this
- [09:33] right now. You have a lot of companies
- [09:34] have reasonable products and they've
- [09:36] they've their growth has slowed. Why?
- [09:38] Could be the economy because it's not as
- [09:40] good as a lot of indicators say. We all
- [09:41] know that for example jobs are not as
- [09:43] good as the indicators say. It could be
- [09:45] because AI or the threat of AI or the
- [09:47] expectation of the of AI blah blah blah.
- [09:49] Who knows? It also can just be size. As
- [09:52] you get bigger, growth slows because you
- [09:54] know what? You're not going to grow 2x a
- [09:56] year forever. So it slows. um there's
- [09:59] like just mechanical things. So there's
- [10:01] many reasons why things slow and
- [10:03] sometimes it's all of a sudden although
- [10:04] then maybe there's some event like an
- [10:06] algorithm changes or you know something
- [10:08] happens but actually I think what's
- [10:09] really common is it just slowly gets
- [10:11] slower. In other words, it decelerates
- [10:14] but just it it kind of I don't I
- [10:17] wouldn't say sneaks up on you because
- [10:18] most people are looking at growth all
- [10:19] the time. So, it's not sneaky, but it is
- [10:22] it is sort of um uh a little bit more
- [10:25] gradual, right? Just like you just feel
- [10:27] more like you're running through mud,
- [10:29] like ah god, we're just still doing so
- [10:31] much work and it's not having as much of
- [10:33] an impact. And so, um that's what I see.
- [10:36] And when I say that's what I see, so
- [10:38] I've built four companies. The last one
- [10:40] is a unicorn. The one before that was
- [10:41] also a unicorn. The boot the the
- [10:44] previous one was bootstrap. This one was
- [10:45] VC funded. And I've invested in about 60
- [10:47] startups. Some of them failed
- [10:49] completely. Some of them were very
- [10:50] successful, some in the middle cuz of
- [10:52] course, right? Um, and uh, so when I say
- [10:55] that's what I've seen, this is that's
- [10:56] the the context of what I mean by what
- [10:58] I've seen. So there's a there's I
- [11:00] wouldn't say a checklist, but there's a
- [11:01] there's a series of of questions that I
- [11:03] ask to to diagnose why is growth slowing
- [11:06] in this order because it's one of these
- [11:08] things where the first one that's a
- [11:10] problem, if you don't fix that, it
- [11:13] doesn't matter if you fix one of the
- [11:14] ones below. Um, just like if I don't
- [11:16] know, maybe if you had a marketing
- [11:17] funnel and there's a step where
- [11:18] everything falls apart and you're like,
- [11:20] well, I'll I'll just uh tune the bottom
- [11:22] of it a little. It's like that's not
- [11:23] going to work. It's not going to help
- [11:25] enough like you got to you got to go
- [11:26] where the biggest issue is. So, this is
- [11:28] in that sort of order.
- [11:30] So, the first question is uh is are
- [11:32] customers leaving? I.e. logo churn,
- [11:35] right? Churn with N. You can do churn
- [11:36] with MR2, but just for simplicity, let's
- [11:39] say uh let's say with customers and it's
- [11:41] the worst problem for a couple reasons.
- [11:43] One is there's nothing you can do about
- [11:44] it once it happens. Like they're gone.
- [11:46] There's no saving them, increasing their
- [11:48] revenue. Like there there's nothing in
- [11:50] the future you can do. Also, it's often
- [11:53] correlated with things like negative
- [11:54] reviews or other things on social media,
- [11:57] which is another kind of preventing
- [11:58] growth. So, it's kind of the two two a
- [12:01] two punch thing of like they're not here
- [12:03] and they may be like actively hurting
- [12:05] your growth. So, that sucks. The math is
- [12:07] undeniable, which I want to talk about
- [12:09] because this is something where there's
- [12:11] a metric I like that is unusual and um
- [12:14] people find uh useful. But before I get
- [12:16] to the metric, there's also this kind of
- [12:18] visceral thing which is the customers
- [12:21] saying this product I don't want it. And
- [12:25] when I think about the gauntlet they got
- [12:27] they went through to get to the product,
- [12:29] they how do they even find out about me?
- [12:31] That was hard already and improbable
- [12:33] that they see an ad or hear it and then
- [12:35] they clicked which is improbable and
- [12:37] then they they didn't just bounce off
- [12:38] the homepage which is again improbable.
- [12:40] They actually were like oh yeah this
- [12:42] sounds pretty good and then they got to
- [12:43] the pricing page and that didn't scare
- [12:44] them off. They actually had the budget
- [12:46] and bought the stupid thing. Then they
- [12:48] went through onboarding and invested
- [12:49] their time etc etc. That is a crazy
- [12:52] gauntlet that almost no one gets
- [12:53] through. And after all of that which
- [12:55] clearly means they wanted it to work.
- [12:57] They're like, "No, bye. What?" Like,
- [13:00] like just on a just on an emotional
- [13:02] level, you gotta go, "Wait a minute,
- [13:04] that's terrible. I'm I'm fundamentally
- [13:06] not fulfilling whatever promise I made
- [13:08] or they thought I made, which is whether
- [13:10] that's a product issue or a
- [13:11] communication issue." Okay? Like there's
- [13:12] lots of But one way or another, like
- [13:15] something is really fundamentally broken
- [13:18] just in terms of like I'm a product
- [13:19] person. So, what I want to do is make a
- [13:21] product that other people want to buy
- [13:22] and use. And if they don't, like no
- [13:24] matter what the metrics say, I'm, you
- [13:26] know, I'm a I'm we're failing our
- [13:28] mission, our customers, whatever. So
- [13:30] there's just even that non-mmathematical
- [13:32] reason to go, oh my god. Right? So uh so
- [13:37] to me that's already enough reason, but
- [13:39] the the the math is very interesting.
- [13:41] And what I find is when I talk to
- [13:42] people, especially on Twitter or
- [13:44] something where people are just, you
- [13:45] know, yapping around whatever they're
- [13:47] doing, you you say thing I say things
- [13:49] like, you know, anything above 3% per
- [13:51] month cancellation is is is terrible.
- [13:53] And people like, oh no, it's okay. Five
- [13:55] is fine, seven, six. Everyone's yapping
- [13:56] about what they and it's very abstract
- [13:59] like who is four better much worse than
- [14:01] five? Like I don't know. And I heard
- [14:03] someone else and blah blah blah. So it's
- [14:04] very um I don't know like like generic
- [14:07] and rough. So there's a different metric
- [14:10] that I like to use which is uh- which
- [14:13] which um which keys off of this idea
- [14:15] that I think again people uh don't
- [14:17] appreciate which is cancellations grow
- [14:21] faster than marketing and so
- [14:24] cancellations overpower the growth of
- [14:26] the company and slow it to a halt i.e.
- [14:29] growth slows right to where you
- [14:32] literally cannot grow anymore. there's a
- [14:35] maximum ceiling of how big you could
- [14:36] ever be thanks to cancellations. And
- [14:39] when you know what that number is, it's
- [14:41] much more real and visceral and scary.
- [14:44] And so, just to kind of justify what I
- [14:46] just said, just imagine any company and
- [14:48] imagine you just tripled the number of
- [14:50] customers that are there and paying and
- [14:52] the same kind, the same age, you know,
- [14:54] just the same kind of stuff just
- [14:55] tripled, right, overnight.
- [14:58] So, the next month, would marketing
- [15:00] deliver more new customers than a month
- [15:02] before? No, because marketing doesn't it
- [15:06] none of your marketing efforts care how
- [15:08] many customers you have. Adwords
- [15:09] delivers the same number of leads and
- [15:11] you know SEO delivers the same like it
- [15:14] does not care how big you are these
- [15:15] these these efforts. So you're you're
- [15:17] you're still going to be growing at the
- [15:18] same rate as you were the previous
- [15:20] month, but cancellations in absolute
- [15:22] terms like the number of customers who
- [15:24] leave will triple cuz you have 5%
- [15:27] cancellation and triple. Okay, so still
- [15:30] 5% of a tripled number is triple, right?
- [15:32] Like so this is the point is that
- [15:34] cancellations automatically grow as you
- [15:36] grow. Even if you're doing everything
- [15:38] right, but marketing doesn't. Marketing
- [15:41] grows only as fast as you can improve
- [15:42] marketing. We all know that's quite hard
- [15:44] actually. It's linear. It's hard to find
- [15:46] new channels that aren't trivial. Like,
- [15:48] it's hard. Of course, we're going to do
- [15:50] it, but like it it's hard. Whereas,
- [15:51] cancellations grow automatically as you
- [15:54] grow, right? So, cancellations always
- [15:57] overtake marketing for this reason.
- [15:58] >> Like the metaphor here is a leaky bucket
- [16:00] where are you adding enough water to
- [16:02] keep up with the leak essentially,
- [16:03] >> right? Except the leaks automatically
- [16:05] increase and that's what people don't
- [16:06] appreciate.
- [16:07] >> Because it's a percentage of your entire
- [16:09] customer base.
- [16:10] >> Yes. See, we say when in marketing we
- [16:12] say things like um I'm adding 100 leads
- [16:13] a month, but in cancellations we say 5%.
- [16:16] Why do you say percent? Because it's
- [16:18] based on your size and it's exponential.
- [16:20] That's what 5% is an exponential. And
- [16:22] and so there's this maximum size you
- [16:24] could ever be. It's when churn equals
- [16:26] growth, right? Like that's that's the m
- [16:28] So how would you compute that? It's
- [16:30] actually quite simple because let's say
- [16:32] you have this 5% per month just as a
- [16:34] number. So it's simply the amount of new
- [16:37] customers you add divided by that
- [16:39] cancellation rate. That is the amount
- [16:42] that that is the limit. So let's suppose
- [16:44] you add 100 customers a month and you
- [16:46] have 5% cancellation. So 100 divided by
- [16:49] 5% is 2,000. So a company like that will
- [16:52] never have more than 2,000 customers.
- [16:54] And by the way as you approach that
- [16:55] number growth is very slow because you
- [16:58] bring in a bunch of customers and almost
- [16:59] the same number leave. So growth is
- [17:01] slowing. Ah, look, we diagnosed why go
- [17:04] slows automatically at all SAS
- [17:06] companies. So that's is why this is the
- [17:07] first thing because it's so it's such a
- [17:09] hard cap limit and it means that people
- [17:12] don't want your product. Like these are
- [17:13] two reasons why it's the most important
- [17:14] thing.
- [17:14] >> Just to clarify, this is logo churn.
- [17:16] This is like number of customers, not
- [17:18] revenue churn.
- [17:19] >> Yeah. Well, it is both logo churn and
- [17:22] revenue churn. You do the same math. You
- [17:24] could say dollars in divided by dollars
- [17:27] cancellation rate or number of co I've
- [17:29] been saying number of customers just to
- [17:30] keep it simple because I think when when
- [17:32] you look at it and say wow we will never
- [17:34] have more than 2,000 customers. It's
- [17:37] just such a like a like a visceral oh my
- [17:40] god we had to do something about that.
- [17:42] Now of course one thing you could do is
- [17:44] have more marketing but you know that
- [17:45] already if growth is slowing you're
- [17:47] already thinking how do I get more out
- [17:49] of marketing. You knew that. The point
- [17:51] is that cancellation is this hard limit
- [17:53] pulling you down with all these other
- [17:54] really bad either implications or side
- [17:57] effects which is why it's so important.
- [17:58] >> Cool. And when you say marketing, just
- [18:00] to clarify, this includes basically all
- [18:01] growth work, PLG stuff, marketing,
- [18:03] sales.
- [18:04] >> Y right.
- [18:05] >> Great.
- [18:06] >> Yeah. PLG is nice, but that doesn't you
- [18:08] still need marketing to bring the people
- [18:09] in in the first place. PLG just means
- [18:11] there's not a salesperson unless you're
- [18:12] expanding or some other segment.
- [18:14] >> Cool. Yeah. It's like the whole bucket
- [18:15] of just bringing new customers in.
- [18:16] >> Yeah. Yeah.
- [18:18] >> So, okay. So assuming you agree like,
- [18:20] "Yeah, I don't like customers leaving.
- [18:22] That sucks." Um, so obviously you got to
- [18:24] find out why they're canceling and do
- [18:25] something about it. And the the the kind
- [18:28] of root issue here is they don't want to
- [18:29] tell you like they're already out the
- [18:31] door. They've already like stopped
- [18:33] investing in you like mentally. So the
- [18:35] last thing they want to do is spend time
- [18:36] with you or like really think about it
- [18:38] and diagnose it with you. And uh I have
- [18:40] a funny story about this for myself. So
- [18:43] um at Smart Bear, people would cancel.
- [18:44] We put up this uh form and and uh a
- [18:47] drop-own list, you know, too expensive,
- [18:49] it's project ended, you know, this stuff
- [18:51] like we do so we could gather data and
- [18:54] um one of them did have more uh more
- [18:56] selection than than the rest. And I
- [18:58] realized it was the first one on the
- [18:59] list and I thought, huh, I wonder if
- [19:01] people are just picking the first one.
- [19:03] So then then we randomized the list so
- [19:05] everyone saw a different order of the
- [19:07] list and now all the items were picked
- [19:08] equally like, oh, right, it's complete
- [19:12] noise. And uh I know other companies
- [19:14] have done similar things also with the
- [19:16] similar results that this is this is a
- [19:17] global phenomenon. So okay so what do
- [19:20] you do like the point is it's hard
- [19:22] right? So the first thing is you want to
- [19:26] ask open-ended questions. I I know it's
- [19:28] you want to just get a list but this is
- [19:30] the problem. At least with open-ended
- [19:32] questions most people won't answer but
- [19:33] at least you might be able to get some
- [19:35] kind of thing that they generated. And
- [19:36] when you do this the the wrong way is to
- [19:39] ask why did you cancel? Because again,
- [19:41] this allows them to say something really
- [19:42] simple like budget, which may or may not
- [19:45] be true. I'll get to that in a second.
- [19:46] What you want to do is say what made you
- [19:49] cancel?
- [19:51] In other words, what about the product
- [19:53] or situation or whatever caused the
- [19:56] cancellation? Just phrasing it that way,
- [19:58] you get much better results. And I stole
- [20:00] this from a company called Groove, who
- [20:02] has this great case study online about
- [20:04] this very thing. They had an email that
- [20:06] they sent out, which is a very a great
- [20:08] email. and um and they started by asking
- [20:11] why did you cancel? They got 10% usable
- [20:13] responses. They changed it same email to
- [20:15] why what made you cancel and it's 20%
- [20:18] usable responses. So this is this is
- [20:20] there's like I guess maybe some anecd
- [20:33] as as far as you can into there because
- [20:34] most people won't talk. The temptation
- [20:36] is to hear what they generate at first
- [20:39] and say that's the answer. So like a
- [20:41] really common one is it's too expensive.
- [20:43] I think anyone who's looked at
- [20:44] cancellation data at any company will
- [20:46] agree that too expensive is often the
- [20:48] number one or at least like top three
- [20:49] reason in one form or another. And that
- [20:51] is never ever ever the reason.
- [20:54] How do I know? Because they already
- [20:56] looked at your homepage, read all the
- [20:58] stuff, saw what you promised, looked at
- [20:59] the pricing page, and decided to buy it.
- [21:03] That means it whatever was in their mind
- [21:05] of what it is is not too expensive. It
- [21:08] was they already decided with their
- [21:10] actions. It was not too expensive.
- [21:14] Something else happened like but you
- [21:16] didn't fulfill the promise that at least
- [21:17] they thought you made or something else
- [21:20] didn't work or you know now it is
- [21:23] possible they lost budget but that
- [21:25] doesn't mean you're too expensive. That
- [21:26] means they lost budget. That's a very
- [21:27] different reason, right? That's not that
- [21:30] you're So it's sort of like um this
- [21:34] happens in um in healthc care for
- [21:35] example. So when someone dies the doctor
- [21:37] has to write the what's called
- [21:39] approximate cause which is what why did
- [21:41] they actually die? But then you try to
- [21:43] also write down the real reason. So
- [21:45] let's say someone comes in and they the
- [21:47] approximate cause of death is they stop
- [21:48] breathing.
- [21:50] Well, you could stop there and that's
- [21:51] like listening to it's expensive and
- [21:53] going that's it. Well, why did they stop
- [21:55] breathing? Um because they they had they
- [21:58] they uh ran their car into a telephone
- [22:00] pole and were injured so much that
- [22:01] eventually they stopped breathing. Well,
- [22:04] why did they run their car into a
- [22:05] telephone pole? Because they passed out
- [22:06] at the wheel. Why' they pass out at the
- [22:08] wheel? Cuz they had undiagnosed
- [22:10] diabetes.
- [22:13] Now we're getting somewhere. It still
- [22:14] isn't just one root cause. Another as a
- [22:16] sidebar, I hate the idea of a root
- [22:18] cause. Complex systems do not have one
- [22:20] root cause. They often have many
- [22:22] interlocking things that could be done
- [22:24] to detect earlier or to change it or to
- [22:27] reduce or and not one root cause. So
- [22:29] root cause analysis to me is by the way
- [22:31] an incorrect thing. I'm explaining why
- [22:33] right now with the healthcare, right?
- [22:34] Because well what about the second
- [22:36] diagnosis? Well, maybe part of the
- [22:37] problem is we have a health care system
- [22:38] that isn't preventative and part of it
- [22:40] is that but they didn't go to the doctor
- [22:41] anyway and you know okay so there's all
- [22:43] kinds of things that could be useful and
- [22:45] interesting to prevent this or make it
- [22:46] better. That's the point. That's what an
- [22:48] analysis should be is this array of
- [22:50] things, not the root cause. Anyway,
- [22:52] something along the lines of undiagnosed
- [22:55] diabetes is much more of a cause than
- [22:57] stopped breathing. So, when we say uh
- [22:59] it's too expensive, and that's the
- [23:02] reason you're making this fallacy. You
- [23:04] got to go into well, they wanted this
- [23:07] stuff, but it didn't work with linear,
- [23:09] which is what they use. It only works
- [23:10] with Jira. And so, there's a lack of
- [23:12] integration. Now, maybe we should write
- [23:13] that integration, maybe we shouldn't. Of
- [23:15] course, it depends on how much we hear
- [23:17] about it. And you know of course it's
- [23:18] going to depend on other things but
- [23:19] that's the reason not it was expensive
- [23:22] right and so so this idea of like
- [23:24] getting into not even the root cause but
- [23:26] let's say rooter causes
- [23:29] >> the root
- [23:30] >> yeah the more root um I think some
- [23:33] people probably say five wise and just
- [23:35] paper over what I just said with that
- [23:37] and maybe so but I just you know let's
- [23:38] not be so simplistic about that because
- [23:41] again five Y sometimes implies that
- [23:42] there's some root cause at the bottom of
- [23:44] the wise let's be a little bit more
- [23:46] Let's be a little more smart about that.
- [23:48] So anyway, these things too expensive.
- [23:50] This is not it. Maybe project ended
- [23:51] really is project ended. Okay. But even
- [23:53] there I see just today today on an on a
- [23:57] on an entrepreneur forum on on I am on
- [23:59] someone said um yeah you know uh we're
- [24:03] starting to see more people have project
- [24:04] ended as the reason. And so there's
- [24:07] nothing we can do about that.
- [24:09] Now see that's incorrect. That's only
- [24:12] true if you only look at the approximate
- [24:13] thing which is project ended. You're
- [24:15] correct that you can't make that project
- [24:16] not end. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. But wait a
- [24:19] minute. If your software was more
- [24:21] successful and the project was more
- [24:23] successful, would it have have ended or
- [24:26] is that actually an indicator that your
- [24:28] product wasn't that useful or didn't do
- [24:30] its job? It's possible. Like in this
- [24:32] case, who knows, right? But that's
- [24:33] possible that it really is your fault.
- [24:36] Um, another example is but you picked
- [24:38] what target segments you were going
- [24:40] after. Did you pick like a market
- [24:43] segment that was easier to sell to but
- [24:45] their projects end like small business
- [24:47] and consumers where very often the small
- [24:50] business does go out of business or the
- [24:52] project ends etc because when things are
- [24:54] small they're they're you know have high
- [24:56] variance and lots of things can knock
- [24:58] them off the the path and so on. And so
- [25:00] is it your fault for picking the wrong
- [25:02] ideal customer profile or target
- [25:05] segment? And so yes, that one case of
- [25:08] that one project, it's not your fault,
- [25:09] quote unquote. But by saying that,
- [25:11] you're you're you're just like ignoring
- [25:12] the fact that there is maybe something
- [25:14] to do about it. Now, all this is maybe.
- [25:16] None of this proves you should like
- [25:17] change your market, right? But but the
- [25:19] fact but when you say it's there's
- [25:20] nothing we could do about it, you you
- [25:22] are closing the door on these things
- [25:24] that might be the right thing. And very
- [25:26] often, as I think probably a lot of
- [25:28] people here on this on this listening to
- [25:30] this know, the market segment you pick
- [25:32] has a lot to do with your retention rate
- [25:34] because everyone acts differently,
- [25:36] right? And so anyway, um, so I I know
- [25:39] it's it's a lot on this topic, but I
- [25:41] just feel constantly people make this
- [25:43] particular mistake of not not getting,
- [25:46] you know, not just like abdicating
- [25:48] responsibility or just listening to the
- [25:49] first thing they they hear and saying
- [25:51] that's the reason and that's not right.
- [25:54] So that's that's the big thing about
- [25:55] listening. Another thing is you got to
- [25:57] ask when people are in trouble but not
- [26:00] yet canceled. You might be able to save
- [26:03] them. You certainly can learn more
- [26:05] because you can talk to them like
- [26:06] they're they're not shut off yet from
- [26:08] you. So this might be they never
- [26:11] uploaded their data so they're not being
- [26:13] successful. They are calling tech
- [26:15] support too much. They're in trouble.
- [26:17] They're not calling tech support enough.
- [26:19] You know they they they're not engaged.
- [26:22] um they didn't log in for a while. Like
- [26:23] there's all kinds of things where where
- [26:25] now of course this is all going to the
- [26:26] details are going to depend on the
- [26:27] product obviously but there are signals
- [26:29] that are correlated with cancellation.
- [26:31] Now if you have a lot of data you can
- [26:33] literally correlate signals with
- [26:34] cancellation and try to extract that um
- [26:37] you know you know precisely but even
- [26:39] without data you can guess and guessing
- [26:40] and having a theory acting accordingly
- [26:43] and as you get more data adjusting your
- [26:45] theory this is a this is a wise way to
- [26:47] proceed even without data. So, if you
- [26:49] can catch them when they seem like
- [26:50] they're off the happy path, they're in
- [26:52] trouble, like that's that's a better
- [26:54] time to do it. And then the last thing I
- [26:56] would say about about um about this
- [26:59] detection is if you don't know what to
- [27:01] do or all else being equal, then focus
- [27:04] on onboarding.
- [27:06] Um all almost all companies have a whole
- [27:09] lot more uh cancellation in the first
- [27:11] day, 30 days, 90 days, depends, right?
- [27:13] But the first period than the whole rest
- [27:16] of the customer's life. And also small
- [27:19] changes in the onboarding can have large
- [27:21] effects on cancellation. Whereas later
- [27:23] on that's not necessarily true. It could
- [27:25] be but it's not necessarily true. So uh
- [27:26] a really dramatic version of this is if
- [27:28] you've ever done YouTube videos which I
- [27:30] I mean I know you have but if a listener
- [27:32] has ever done YouTube video and you see
- [27:34] the retention quote unquote of the of
- [27:36] the viewer on a YouTube video, it has
- [27:37] this thing where it it falls like just
- [27:39] so much you can't believe in the first
- [27:41] 30 seconds and then if if it's a decent
- [27:43] video, it'll flatten out as people you
- [27:45] know decide to watch the video. So, in
- [27:48] that in that crazy looking curve, for
- [27:50] the people that watch it for 15 minutes,
- [27:53] maybe there's something you could do to
- [27:54] keep a few of them staying to the end,
- [27:57] but that's not going to change very much
- [27:58] how many people get to the end. Whereas,
- [28:01] like for me, I've only done a few, but I
- [28:03] what what I see is about 50% fall off in
- [28:05] the first 30 seconds. Well, if I can get
- [28:07] that from 50% to 55% stay,
- [28:11] um, that's an additional and and at the
- [28:14] end of of the line, I only have 20%
- [28:16] still there, which is pretty good for a
- [28:17] long longer video. But if I get it from
- [28:19] 50 to 55, I might get it go from 20 to
- [28:21] 25% staying. In other words, if I shift
- [28:24] to 10% at the front, which maybe I could
- [28:26] do, like I can't be dramatic, but maybe
- [28:28] a little, then in the output, I might be
- [28:30] able to increase it by 20 30%.
- [28:33] So that's a huge change. And so in the
- [28:35] SAS equivalent is, as we all know, if
- [28:37] they leave early, not only is it bad,
- [28:39] but it's super unprofitable because you
- [28:41] spent all this money to acquire them and
- [28:42] then they never stayed around long
- [28:43] enough to pay it back, much less to be
- [28:45] profitable. So if you can do a little
- [28:47] bit in the onboarding or shift the
- [28:49] onboarding percentage a little bit, it
- [28:50] pays off enormously in revenue and
- [28:52] profit over time by by uh by making them
- [28:56] successful. And uh so again, if you
- [28:58] don't know what to do, onboarding is is
- [29:00] a good bet. And even if you do know what
- [29:02] to do, I'll I'll still bet that
- [29:03] onboarding is a good bet for where to
- [29:06] go.
- [29:06] >> Oh man, I'm so happy we're spending so
- [29:08] much time on this very specific first
- [29:10] step of logo turnurn because the way you
- [29:12] described it is so visceral. You've
- [29:15] spent it took so much. It's like
- [29:17] impossible how far this customer got
- [29:19] already. Like they are using your
- [29:22] product and understand it
- [29:24] >> mostly and then they still decide to
- [29:27] leave. so brutal the way
- [29:29] >> and you're going to believe them when
- [29:30] they say it's because of the cost,
- [29:33] >> right? Like it just doesn't even make
- [29:34] sense when you put it that way, right?
- [29:36] >> So, let me uh let me kind of uh
- [29:37] summarize the advice you shared here
- [29:39] because this is so good. So, step one is
- [29:42] look at logo churn. The way to
- [29:44] understand and essentially to understand
- [29:46] how big of a problem this is and why you
- [29:48] need to spend time here is uh look at
- [29:50] this basically do the math uh what's how
- [29:53] many new customers you're getting
- [29:54] divided by the cancellation rate and
- [29:56] that essentially tells you what's like
- [29:58] if that doesn't change what's the
- [29:59] maximum number of customers you will
- [30:00] ever have
- [30:01] >> exactly
- [30:02] >> that's going to be a sad number and then
- [30:03] the question is okay cool how do I
- [30:05] reduce the cancellation rate obviously
- [30:06] as you said everyone wants new customers
- [30:07] more new customers
- [30:08] >> yeah and you'll I know you're going to
- [30:09] do that anyway but you got this cap
- [30:12] >> exactly okay so the Okay. So, a few
- [30:14] things you've shared here. One is
- [30:16] instead of asking people in option uh
- [30:18] multiple choice, why did you decide to
- [30:20] cancel? You make it free form and you
- [30:21] make the question, how would you say it?
- [30:23] Was it what made you cancel?
- [30:25] >> What made you cancel?
- [30:26] >> What made you cancel? Great.
- [30:28] >> Yeah.
- [30:28] >> And then you could use AI to help
- [30:30] summarize these things, I imagine,
- [30:31] instead of
- [30:32] >> Yeah. Um I think what I find with AI is
- [30:34] this with this sort of thing with
- [30:36] surveys, um is this
- [30:38] >> AI is good at picking out themes.
- [30:40] >> Yeah. It is bad at picking out details
- [30:43] that are actionable.
- [30:45] >> When I say AI, of course, I mean LLMs,
- [30:47] which is probably what we mean when
- [30:49] we're looking at natural language,
- [30:50] right? Um, and if you think about it, it
- [30:53] sort of makes sense because the LLM is
- [30:55] an averaging machine, right? It's
- [30:58] predicting the most likely that's an
- [30:59] averaging kind of a thing. And so when
- [31:02] what you're looking for is a kind of
- [31:04] average, it's usually pretty good. So,
- [31:06] summarization,
- [31:08] topics, themes. But when you're asking
- [31:10] for like what is interesting and not
- [31:12] average, it's actually pretty bad at it.
- [31:15] One uh one way that I found that's sort
- [31:17] of useful is yes, I'll ask it about
- [31:19] themes, but then I'll say now pick out
- [31:21] every specific detail that goes under
- [31:23] one of these themes, put it along with
- [31:26] like which customer said it and the link
- [31:28] to, you know, blah blah blah. So, you'd
- [31:30] have to, you know, play with this to
- [31:31] tune it, right? But like that kind of
- [31:32] thing so that a human being can then
- [31:34] still see the detail which is what
- [31:36] triggers in your mind. Wait a minute but
- [31:38] that means we should do that right cuz
- [31:39] the topics won't do that. The topics
- [31:42] will be I already know what the topics
- [31:43] will be. It'll be stuff like I couldn't
- [31:45] figure out how to do this this
- [31:47] integration right like the the the
- [31:49] topics are actually not going to be that
- [31:51] surprising probably. It's the details
- [31:53] that are going to be the triggers for
- [31:56] action actionable stuff or patterns or
- [31:59] something like that. So yeah, AI is not
- [32:02] useless, but it's not as useful as it
- [32:05] sounds. It's probably still a good idea
- [32:07] to just read all this stuff. Although AI
- [32:10] might be able to clean up, you know,
- [32:11] maybe people's grammar is bad. It's a
- [32:12] weird language. Okay. Yes. Like that's
- [32:15] annoying. You could clean that up, but I
- [32:17] wouldn't rely on AI to do the thinking
- [32:18] for that reason.
- [32:20] >> That's such such good advice. I actually
- [32:21] have a really cool guest post coming out
- [32:23] soon that gives a bunch of really
- [32:25] specific techniques to avoid AI uh
- [32:28] hallucinating or just giving you really
- [32:30] bad uh results from this very specific
- [32:33] synthesis work because it turns out AI
- [32:35] is very uh not great at actually being
- [32:38] honest about some of the stuff. So
- [32:40] >> we'll link to it if it comes out before
- [32:41] this. And like I think in real life most
- [32:43] people don't have that much the volume
- [32:45] of these cancellations unless it's like
- [32:47] a super consumer app is not that high.
- [32:49] So, you don't even need AF for this.
- [32:51] Just like read it. And then this is a
- [32:52] good segue to your next piece of advice,
- [32:54] which is uh essentially the five W's,
- [32:56] but not the five W's where you kind of
- [32:58] force yourself to dig into what's the
- [33:00] real reason that forced them to cancel.
- [33:02] It's probably not pricing. It's probably
- [33:04] not the project ended. There's something
- [33:05] deeper.
- [33:06] >> Yeah.
- [33:07] >> And then, uh, advice number three is try
- [33:09] to catch people early. Try to catch them
- [33:12] before they turn. If you don't have a
- [33:14] lot of customers, it's a lot easier. If
- [33:15] you have a lot, it's obviously harder.
- [33:17] Uh there's always been this like holy
- [33:18] grail idea of a product that just like
- [33:20] watches metrics and tells you this
- [33:21] person is about to cancel. I see that.
- [33:23] >> What I would say is it's it it is it is
- [33:26] not hard. You don't need a lot of
- [33:28] customers in to to go talk to the ones
- [33:31] who are in trouble.
- [33:32] >> Mhm.
- [33:33] >> You do need a lot of data or customers
- [33:36] to mathematically know what behaviors
- [33:38] are correlated with cancel and therefore
- [33:40] to spend your time wisely. Then you need
- [33:42] a lot more data. But to your point, even
- [33:44] if you have the data, it's not entirely
- [33:46] clear whether some kind of mechanistic
- [33:48] thing is all that important. One way I
- [33:50] look at it is, you know, it's it's very
- [33:52] common advice. You should try to get
- [33:53] more good customers and fewer bad
- [33:55] customers. Of course, you should. And so
- [33:56] therefore, it they say you should see
- [33:59] what the good customers have in common.
- [34:02] But that's not the end of the sentence
- [34:04] because a lot of the things the good
- [34:05] customers have in common, they also have
- [34:07] in common with the bad customers because
- [34:10] it's just what your customers do. just
- [34:13] what anybody does. So, it's what the
- [34:15] good customers have in common that are
- [34:16] different from what the bad customers
- [34:18] have in common.
- [34:20] Okay. So, with that in mind, this kind
- [34:21] of like it has to be both or else you're
- [34:23] you're sort of not getting you're just
- [34:25] getting correlations that are that are
- [34:26] not helpful. Um the cancellations or or
- [34:30] talking to people who are in trouble is
- [34:32] is another application of that. So, what
- [34:34] is correlated with people who actually
- [34:35] end up cancelling, not just what you
- [34:37] know and so um I think that mindset is
- [34:41] is correct. if if you add the other side
- [34:43] of that to it.
- [34:44] >> A really important nuance.
- [34:46] >> Yeah.
- [34:46] >> Okay. And then the final step just to
- [34:48] close this out is onboarding. Work on
- [34:49] onboarding activation. Uh something
- [34:51] that's one of the most recurring themes
- [34:53] on this podcast is just the power across
- [34:55] every dimension of improving onboarding.
- [34:57] Improving activation.
- [34:58] >> Yeah.
- [34:59] >> Sweet. Okay. So, this is just step one,
- [35:02] which is already full of gold if your
- [35:04] growth has slowed. So, step one is focus
- [35:06] on or your logo churn, the number of
- [35:08] customers leaving, people leaving,
- [35:09] actually canceling your your product. So
- [35:11] I I kind of look at it like a question.
- [35:12] So like the first question is are are
- [35:14] people leaving it too much? Because if
- [35:16] your if your monthly cancellation is 2%
- [35:18] for SMB, that's good. So you could try
- [35:21] to work on it, but since it's already
- [35:22] good, it's still probably a good idea to
- [35:25] work. It's it's probably a good ROI for
- [35:27] you to work on it, but it's possible
- [35:28] that you're got diminishing returns and
- [35:30] that this isn't really the reason or
- [35:32] it's not really reasonable for it to go.
- [35:33] I mean, how low can it go for SMB? Like
- [35:35] there's some floor and you might be near
- [35:37] it. So the first question is like is is
- [35:39] is logo turn too high and trying to set
- [35:42] a threshold that you know lower than
- [35:44] what people normally want to do. So the
- [35:47] next the next question I have is is the
- [35:49] pricing correct which of course pricing
- [35:51] is a perennially interesting topic. I
- [35:53] know there's this funny thing of uh
- [35:55] especially with newer companies that the
- [35:56] pricing is always too low. It's not
- [35:58] always but like that's the common thing.
- [36:00] Patrick Campbell who has 4,200 data
- [36:04] points about startups. Let that sink in
- [36:07] a little. Um has this great quote which
- [36:09] goes like this. Your prices are way too
- [36:11] low because you just guessed and you
- [36:13] haven't changed them. It's like yeah, if
- [36:16] you really like look look deep within
- [36:18] you realize like yeah or we just picked
- [36:20] whatever our competitors are doing and
- [36:22] and and that's it or we added or
- [36:23] subtracted something because reasons and
- [36:27] right that's probably not good. And
- [36:29] people are scared to raise prices for
- [36:30] obvious reasons. But the but the if we
- [36:33] set aside the emotional reasons whether
- [36:36] they're correct or not, the the sort of
- [36:37] economic reason people normally give is
- [36:39] they have in their mind this e this
- [36:41] microeconomic supply and demand curve
- [36:42] thing. And the demand curve says that if
- [36:45] you raise the price, demand goes down.
- [36:46] That's why demand curve is always going
- [36:48] that way, right? And so they understand,
- [36:51] I think everyone understands, right? But
- [36:54] maybe you raise prices by 10%. But
- [36:56] signups go down only 5%. So overall,
- [36:59] it's better. But the opposite could
- [37:02] happen too if I'm on the other side of
- [37:03] the demand curve. And okay, so that's
- [37:05] that's how most people think of it.
- [37:06] However, this is not how it works.
- [37:09] So that's how it works in microecon
- [37:11] microeconomics 101 textbooks. That's not
- [37:13] how it works in the real world often. So
- [37:16] what usually h what often happens is you
- [37:17] raise prices and signups don't change.
- [37:20] When I say signups, I mean the like
- [37:21] signups per month, you know, the rate at
- [37:22] sign or signups go up.
- [37:25] This happens all the time. Even even for
- [37:28] like soloreneurs on Twitter who have,
- [37:30] you know, strange projects or
- [37:31] everything. Happens all the time. They
- [37:33] raise prices. They're like, I was
- [37:34] scared, but then then sus went up. I
- [37:37] once talked to a guy. This is this is
- [37:38] really funny. I'm not I'm going to not
- [37:40] say the name to protect the protect the
- [37:42] name, right? But but um but uh so he had
- [37:46] a product that was that he was selling
- [37:48] essentially to enterprise and
- [37:49] government, so larger companies. And it
- [37:51] was to me way too cheap. So he said
- [37:53] something like, "Yeah, I charge $300."
- [37:56] I'm like, " $300 a month? That's not
- [37:57] enough." He goes, "No, per year." Like,
- [38:00] "Okay, wait." I said, "Okay, just do me
- [38:02] a f how many signups do you get a week?"
- [38:04] And he's like, "One or two?" Because
- [38:05] this is enterprise and it was a startup.
- [38:08] I said, "Okay, um, just for fun, just
- [38:12] change it from per month, per year to
- [38:14] per month." So, in other words, we're
- [38:16] 12xing the price, right?
- [38:19] So he did and he still got one or two
- [38:22] per week. Like nothing changed. I'm
- [38:24] like, "Okay, what what are you going to
- [38:26] do next?" And he goes, "Oh my gosh, well
- [38:28] now I have so much more money and
- [38:29] profits. I'm going to like hire an
- [38:30] engineer. I'm going to do this
- [38:32] marketing." And I'm like, "Time out.
- [38:34] What you're going to do is raise prices
- [38:36] again." Like you just told me you you
- [38:38] 12xed the price and nothing observable
- [38:42] changed. That means you're not near the
- [38:44] price yet, right? You're going to you
- [38:46] don't have to 10x it again necessarily.
- [38:48] maybe 2x, maybe 50%, but like you're not
- [38:50] done. I mean, you can do those other
- [38:51] things too, but you're not done with the
- [38:53] price. Like, it didn't even occur to
- [38:54] them still. Okay. So, why does this
- [38:58] happen? Um, the reason is that pricing
- [39:01] selects the market.
- [39:04] So if you only think of the market as
- [39:07] people with very limited budgets, barely
- [39:09] can do anything, not getting much value
- [39:11] out of it, then it is true that if you
- [39:12] raise prices, you'll get fewer of them
- [39:15] because they were never getting that
- [39:16] much value out of it anyway. They don't
- [39:18] have that much money. So if you raise
- [39:19] prices, they're gone. But think about
- [39:22] just even a mid-size company, forget
- [39:23] about enterprise, just think about a
- [39:24] company with a thousand employees and
- [39:26] 400 million in revenue or whatever. And
- [39:28] um if they see a product that's, you
- [39:31] know, $2 a month or even $100 a month,
- [39:34] their thought is like, well, that can't
- [39:36] be good enough. They're not mature
- [39:38] enough. It's not going to do enough. The
- [39:40] support's not going to be good enough.
- [39:42] They probably don't have good governance
- [39:43] policies or other things that we need,
- [39:44] you know, etc. Whether that's true or
- [39:46] not, like this is what it looks like is
- [39:47] it's lowquality, cheap, whatever, aimed
- [39:50] at SMB. So, they just won't buy. They're
- [39:53] not in the market for the thing. So it's
- [39:56] not true that they have this demand
- [39:57] curve where oh since it's cheap they all
- [39:59] want it. That's what that's what micro
- [40:02] economics curve says. It's so cheap that
- [40:04] they should all want it. No, they don't.
- [40:06] None of them want it because it looks
- [40:07] bad. So as it gets into a price range
- [40:09] that makes sense for the kinds of things
- [40:11] that they need. Then their demand
- [40:13] actually goes up. Then it can stay up
- [40:15] while it's in a good range. And then of
- [40:17] course at some point you are priced out
- [40:19] of them that that particular kind of
- [40:21] company's like I'm not going to spend
- [40:22] $10 million a year on it. Are you
- [40:24] kidding? So yes, it does slope down and
- [40:25] go away. So it's not a normal curve, but
- [40:27] it is like it slopes up and then it's
- [40:29] something and slopes down. Who knows
- [40:30] exactly what it looks what what shape it
- [40:32] is? Probably none of us know, but it's
- [40:34] more like a messa and not a line that
- [40:37] goes up to down like we like in the
- [40:40] textbook. For that market, it's only the
- [40:43] very lowest, you might even say worst in
- [40:46] terms of metrics end of the market that
- [40:48] has the microeconomic slope that you're
- [40:50] worried about. So what happens is you
- [40:52] raise prices and you enter a different
- [40:53] market and that's why the signups go up
- [40:56] or okay
- [40:57] uh you leave behind perhaps a worse
- [41:00] market anyway and of course everyone
- [41:02] will tell you you know the more they pay
- [41:04] the higher retention is and that you
- [41:06] know like all the all the kinds of stuff
- [41:08] gets better when you when you u when you
- [41:10] charge more. So this question is pricing
- [41:12] correct? This is kind of what what's in
- [41:13] my mind when I ask that question. It's
- [41:15] like probably the answer is no because
- [41:17] pricing is very hard. It's just as much
- [41:19] art as it is science. Um, you've had
- [41:21] some really good people on here on
- [41:23] pricing. In fact, so good that I've
- [41:24] bought some of the books that those
- [41:26] people have talked about because I I
- [41:28] love the interview so much. Right. So,
- [41:30] so like um so I I believe in all that.
- [41:33] No pro no problem. I believe in it. Um,
- [41:35] nevertheless, they also say it's art and
- [41:36] science and it's it's it's very
- [41:38] difficult to uh and and also once you
- [41:40] augur it in the world changes like 5 10
- [41:43] years later, the market is different.
- [41:44] The world's different and uh so it's
- [41:46] still it's still unclear. Also, price is
- [41:49] not just the number on the web page.
- [41:51] It's easy to think that, right? But how
- [41:54] it's structured is just as important.
- [41:56] How the product's positioned is just as
- [41:58] important. So, for example,
- [42:01] this example I've written about before
- [42:03] um online is uh uh this example it
- [42:08] actually was something that um that I
- [42:10] that happened in my life, but I I
- [42:12] changed the story to make it like simple
- [42:14] and and real and clear without having to
- [42:16] get into lots of detail. So, the the
- [42:18] sort of story version is uh how this
- [42:22] company was able to charge eight times
- [42:24] as much for the same product just by
- [42:26] talking about it differently.
- [42:29] So just by positioning it differently,
- [42:31] eight times as much. Again, this
- [42:32] happened to me, but it's it's too
- [42:34] complicated. It's not not interesting.
- [42:35] Those details are not interesting. So
- [42:37] say there's this company called Double
- [42:38] Down, and the idea is that it hves the
- [42:41] cost of your AdWords because it makes it
- [42:42] so efficient.
- [42:44] So that's what it says on the web page.
- [42:46] Cut your AdWords cost in half.
- [42:49] Which is a very good pitch, isn't it?
- [42:50] Simple, obviously valuable. But when you
- [42:53] think, so let's suppose uh I have a I'm
- [42:55] a customer and I spend $40,000 a month
- [42:57] on AdWords.
- [42:59] What am I willing to pay for Double
- [43:01] Down? Well, if you do cut my AdWords in
- [43:04] half, then all right, I save I save 20K,
- [43:07] but I'm not willing to give 20K to
- [43:09] Double Down because then I'm not saving
- [43:10] any money. In order to actually save
- [43:12] money, I need to give Double Down less
- [43:13] money. How much less? I don't know.
- [43:15] Let's just call it a quarter. So, I pay
- [43:17] Double Down 5K to save 20. So, I'm s I'm
- [43:21] really saving 15. Doubled down's making
- [43:23] 5K a month. That's pretty good.
- [43:25] Everyone's pretty happy at this 5 grand
- [43:28] a month price point. So, there's nothing
- [43:31] wrong with this. No one's doing anything
- [43:33] wrong. Like, that's a perfectly valid
- [43:34] company. However,
- [43:36] think about these two situations that
- [43:38] the CMO might be or the chief product
- [43:40] officer might be in in talking to the
- [43:42] CEO at the end of the year. Well,
- [43:45] scenario one goes, we started using this
- [43:48] tool, doubled down, and it haved our
- [43:49] cost. So, we got we able to spend that
- [43:51] money on some other stuff. We were able
- [43:53] to save money. And the CEO go would say,
- [43:54] great, that's good. Let's we're going to
- [43:57] renew and I'm happy to hear it. Again,
- [43:58] nothing wrong here, but let's take a
- [44:01] different tact altogether. What does the
- [44:04] CEO want to hear more? Growth or saves
- [44:06] money? Both are good, but I know which
- [44:09] one is healthier for the company,
- [44:11] increases market share, is better
- [44:13] competitively, and also makes the
- [44:15] company more valuable. It's the growth.
- [44:19] So, what we'd really like the CMO to
- [44:21] tell the CEO is, I increase the growth
- [44:25] rate of the company, not so much I save
- [44:27] money. That was way better. So, here's
- [44:30] how we could do that with Double Down.
- [44:32] Yes, Double Down has the cost, but what
- [44:34] that means is right now, right now, the
- [44:37] company is paying 200 bucks per lead.
- [44:40] Let's call them leads, right? Whatever,
- [44:41] whatever this is outputting, right?
- [44:44] Well, if I have the cost of a lead, I
- [44:47] could get twice the leads for the same
- [44:49] money. I'm already willing to spend $200
- [44:51] a lead and I'm already spending 40k a
- [44:54] month for it. So, if Doubledown has the
- [44:57] cost, it means I can get more leads.
- [45:00] So what I the way I could pitch double
- [45:02] down is double the leads per month with
- [45:06] period.
- [45:08] Now if I'm willing to spend 40k for this
- [45:11] number of leads, how much am I willing
- [45:12] to spend to double the leads? 40k.
- [45:16] I just said I'm willing to spend 40k for
- [45:18] this number of leads. So doubling it.
- [45:20] I'm willing to spend 40k to double it.
- [45:22] So if I give double down 40k not five
- [45:27] for the same product which is the leads
- [45:29] are cheaper but then now the pitch is I
- [45:31] doubled the leads for 40k instead of h
- [45:34] instead of having the cost for 5k so
- [45:36] double down gets 8x the money because it
- [45:39] gets 40k for this product not eight not
- [45:41] not 5k for this product
- [45:43] >> amazing story
- [45:44] >> and everyone's happy because the CEO
- [45:45] goes what did you do and they said like
- [45:47] oh my god I doubled leads what yeah I
- [45:50] mean at the same at the at the same ROI
- [45:52] as we had before, same CAC, I doubled
- [45:54] leads. CEO goes, how could we do more of
- [45:56] that? Like, I mean, just everything is
- [45:58] so much better, same product. Now, I
- [46:00] know it's a little bit of an
- [46:01] exaggeration, etc., because I'm trying
- [46:03] to make a point, right? But the but the
- [46:04] the big point is
- [46:08] uh or the the largest point is pricing
- [46:09] is not just the number on the page.
- [46:13] It's positioning. It's how their budgets
- [46:15] work. It's how it's structured. like
- [46:17] it's per site or it's per usage or it's
- [46:19] per seat or it's per all of this stuff
- [46:20] is part of what pricing is. And often
- [46:23] even if it's the same price or the same
- [46:25] product, depending on how that's
- [46:27] structured, it's either seems um fair
- [46:30] and and and good or it seems like unfair
- [46:32] and too expensive or whatever. Um and so
- [46:35] in particular with the positioning, the
- [46:36] big lesson for product managers is
- [46:39] sell more of what the company values
- [46:42] like growth. It doesn't have to be
- [46:43] growth. It could be something else.
- [46:45] Their the retention for their customers
- [46:48] comp their competit how competitive they
- [46:51] are in the market. Like there's various
- [46:52] things they could value. Growth is an
- [46:54] obvious one. Sell them that they're
- [46:57] going to get more of what they value as
- [47:00] opposed to saving cutting ROI
- [47:04] saves time saves money more efficient.
- [47:07] And again there there's nothing wrong
- [47:09] with saving money saves time. It's just
- [47:10] that it caps this price and this value
- [47:13] that is they perceive that you do.
- [47:15] Whereas if you deliver more of the value
- [47:17] that they already value, it's I don't
- [47:19] want to say uncapped completely, but
- [47:21] like the cap is maybe an order of
- [47:23] magnitude higher than saving. So again,
- [47:26] it's it's valuable to save. You're not
- [47:29] doing anything wrong. Like that's not
- [47:30] how to talk about what it is and
- [47:32] therefore help set the price. So yeah,
- [47:36] so it's a it's a long way of saying so
- [47:38] when again when I think is your pricing
- [47:39] correct I'm thinking in a maybe a more
- [47:42] general way than just like the number
- [47:43] I'm thinking about the structure the
- [47:45] positioning and all that and my guess is
- [47:47] when growth is slowing um no that
- [47:50] there's a lot of improvement that could
- [47:51] be that could be had there.
- [47:52] >> Oh man this is such this story is so
- [47:54] powerful who does not want to change
- [47:57] some copy on their website and double
- [47:58] their growth and triple their price. Um
- [48:01] and the the biggest takeaway here is
- [48:03] when you say is pricing correct isn't
- [48:06] like what is the number 20 or 25 or 100
- [48:09] it's it's almost is the market we are
- [48:11] going after correct is the way we are
- [48:14] selling to them correct is this price
- [48:16] communicating the right sort of story
- [48:18] and then also is the positioning of what
- [48:21] problem we solve for you correct so
- [48:23] there's a lot here and luckily I've done
- [48:25] a bunch of episodes along this stuff
- [48:27] which we'll point people to
- [48:29] >> to go much deeper cuz This is a very
- [48:31] >> this is a deep skill and there's a lot
- [48:33] to do here.
- [48:34] >> One thing I'll mention specifically, so
- [48:36] Jen Ael, a recent podcast guest, it was
- [48:38] her second visit to the podcast. She has
- [48:40] a lot of really good advice on this of
- [48:42] just how to price and how to reposition
- [48:44] the way you're selling it. Specifically,
- [48:46] she had this really interesting insight
- [48:48] that enterprises their sweet spot for
- [48:50] contracts is like 75 to 150K. That's
- [48:52] like how they normally buy SAS software.
- [48:54] And it sounds absurd, but that's kind of
- [48:56] what you want to you want your product
- [48:58] to be in that bucket versus like a
- [48:59] thousand a month, 2,000 a month, and
- [49:01] everything just gets easier if you're
- [49:03] like, "Okay, this is one of those. Okay,
- [49:04] cool." It gets easier. Um the thing, uh
- [49:08] I don't want to go off too much of a
- [49:10] tangent, but the the the thing you have
- [49:12] to remember is that pricing is not this
- [49:15] knob that you can turn separately from
- [49:18] the rest of your strategy.
- [49:20] So when you say like even when I just
- [49:23] said raise prices or whatever um but you
- [49:27] can't just raise prices like these new
- [49:30] customers have different demands now
- [49:32] maybe you need sock too now your other
- [49:34] governance stuff matters now integrating
- [49:36] to certain systems you didn't know about
- [49:38] matters maybe now they need professional
- [49:40] services like you can't just raise
- [49:43] prices and change market and like that's
- [49:44] it and maybe that's wise to do but maybe
- [49:48] it's not maybe you realize that sure, of
- [49:51] course, that other market has certain
- [49:52] advantages, but they also have
- [49:53] disadvantages, and we don't want those
- [49:55] either because we'll no longer be
- [49:57] competitive because the way that we're
- [49:58] distinguished, competitive, special,
- [50:00] interesting, valuable is only valuable
- [50:03] in the market we're in. The the next
- [50:05] market does not value it like that. And
- [50:07] so, uh-oh, um, actually, that would be
- [50:09] really bad for us. Or it could even be
- [50:11] cultural. We're a company like Buffer is
- [50:13] a great example. Buffer could go up
- [50:15] market and try to sell, you know, social
- [50:17] media tools or whatever. But they
- [50:19] realized we are a company for the little
- [50:22] people. I don't want to sell to a big
- [50:25] company. We're never going to make a
- [50:26] product for them. We don't want to. This
- [50:29] is who we are. This is what we want to
- [50:30] do. This is what's fulfilling to us. So,
- [50:32] we're not going to go there. So, it can
- [50:34] be cultural. It can be certain goals. It
- [50:36] can be it can be other aspects of of the
- [50:38] business model or the strategy, but you
- [50:39] it's not this kind of like, oh, I'll
- [50:41] just I'll just change this. It's a
- [50:43] decision about the whole strategy and
- [50:44] that too we could talk about for hours.
- [50:46] Um but um I'll just let's just caution
- [50:49] that. Uh oh, I'll just go enterprise
- [50:51] like is is of course not how it goes.
- [50:53] Sorry. We got this.
- [50:55] >> Yeah, I love Jen. Her pricing and and
- [50:57] sales stuff is good. She's great on
- [50:58] Twitter, too. She's I love her. I love
- [50:59] Jen.
- [51:00] >> And that is such an important nuance,
- [51:01] you know. Don't build the thing you're
- [51:02] miserable building and just like, okay,
- [51:04] I listen to a podcast. We're going to
- [51:05] raise our prices 10x and life will be
- [51:07] grand. There's also downsides.
- [51:09] >> Yes.
- [51:11] >> Yeah. Okay. Uh, amazing advice. Okay,
- [51:13] there's so much here. Again, this could
- [51:14] be its own conversation. Pricing,
- [51:16] positioning. Yeah, we'll link folks to a
- [51:18] bunch of cool advice that um we've
- [51:20] covered on this podcast, too.
- [51:22] >> If you're a founder, the hardest part of
- [51:24] starting a company isn't having the
- [51:25] idea, it's scaling the business without
- [51:28] getting buried in back office work.
- [51:30] That's where B comes in. Brex is the
- [51:32] intelligent finance platform for
- [51:34] founders. With Brex, you get high limit
- [51:36] corporate cards, easy banking, high
- [51:38] yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents
- [51:41] that handle manual finance tasks for
- [51:44] you. They'll do all the stuff that you
- [51:46] don't want to do, like file your
- [51:48] expenses, scour transactions for waste,
- [51:50] and run reports, all according to your
- [51:53] rules. With Brex AI agents, you can move
- [51:56] faster while staying in full control.
- [51:58] One in three startups in the United
- [52:00] States already runs on Brex. You can too
- [52:04] at brex.com.
- [52:07] >> Let's keep going through this uh
- [52:08] checklist. So, one was look at logo
- [52:10] churn. Yeah. Two is look at is your
- [52:12] pricing correct?
- [52:13] >> Is pricing right? And why do we why do
- [52:15] we think it is? Because we probably
- [52:17] don't have good reasons yet.
- [52:19] >> Okay. So, the third one is are existing
- [52:21] customers growing? I think everyone
- [52:23] probably knows this but just to say it
- [52:25] um okay if if cancellations overtake
- [52:28] marketing in in in in u magnitude
- [52:32] one way to combat I mean one thing is
- [52:34] okay make cancellations lower but they
- [52:36] can't be zero so another what else do we
- [52:38] have to combat cancellations that would
- [52:40] be proportional to our size so that it
- [52:42] keeps up unlike marketing right or you
- [52:45] know basic direct marketing so one would
- [52:47] be all right 2% left but of the
- [52:50] remaining 98% some of those upgraded or
- [52:54] otherwise paid us more. Maybe it's usage
- [52:55] based, whatever it is, they're paying us
- [52:56] more. And so that that covers the gap
- [52:59] and that's and and yes, if I tripled the
- [53:01] company overnight, that would triple.
- [53:03] And so that's the answer. So that is an
- [53:05] answer. And maybe that's obvious, but
- [53:07] you know, it's useful to tie it back to
- [53:08] the the sort of model mental model we've
- [53:10] got going. Um, and of course the the
- [53:12] metric here is NRR net revenue
- [53:15] retention. And the way that's computed
- [53:18] is you say what is the revenue of
- [53:21] customers right now like so existing
- [53:24] customers existing whatever just the
- [53:25] whole total and then one year from now
- [53:29] what of that remains so not new
- [53:31] customers coming in not talking about
- [53:33] them because we're asking about the
- [53:34] cohort that exists what remains so with
- [53:37] cancels it goes down with downgrades it
- [53:39] goes down but with upgrades it goes up
- [53:41] so when I say remains it could end
- [53:42] higher than we started if upgrades
- [53:45] exceed
- [53:46] cancellations and downgrades and now we
- [53:48] are talking about MR and not N because N
- [53:51] doesn't have this N doesn't have an
- [53:53] upgrade and just only goes down which
- [53:55] again is why I think the N is actually
- [53:57] the most important one
- [54:00] because think about it like a lot of
- [54:01] times people think so if you've heard of
- [54:03] NR you might think well that's my golden
- [54:04] metric I'm done
- [54:06] but the issue is if NR is positive but N
- [54:10] goes down too fast it doesn't matter
- [54:12] because not enough people are left
- [54:15] and so there's not enough people left
- [54:16] over to upgrade and so actually you're
- [54:18] wrong and so NR does not does not
- [54:21] include that and therefore it actually
- [54:22] underounts what's going on in a bad way
- [54:25] like in a way that's that that hurts
- [54:27] you. There's yet another way to see why
- [54:29] what I'm saying is right. You know,
- [54:32] there's this this thing in investments
- [54:33] where let's say I started out at $100
- [54:36] and the stock goes down 5%. So now it's
- [54:38] at 90 or no, it goes down 20%, now it's
- [54:40] at 80. Then it goes up 20%. Is it back
- [54:44] to 100?
- [54:46] No. Because 20% were then 80 is 96. So
- [54:50] if it goes down 20% and up 20%, it does
- [54:53] not come back to zero. It's worse.
- [54:56] When you have a loss, a percentage loss,
- [54:58] you have to have a greater percentage
- [55:00] gain just to get back to where you were.
- [55:03] In this case, a loss of 20% requires a
- [55:05] gain of 25% to get back to where you
- [55:07] were. This is why NR isn't quite right
- [55:10] because NR is saying that a loss of 20%
- [55:13] from cancellations is offset by 20% from
- [55:15] upgrades.
- [55:17] As we just saw, no, it's not. That only
- [55:20] gets us to 96% actually. So, this is why
- [55:23] like again, I believe in NR. saying you
- [55:26] got to lo track it like it's good just
- [55:28] in the back of your mind realize it's
- [55:30] not quite that good and looking at N
- [55:33] helps me keep keeps you honest about
- [55:35] what's really going on with these
- [55:36] customer cohorts right so that's why
- [55:38] they're both useful in fact but that's
- [55:40] this is why they're both useful so NR of
- [55:43] course is important a nice way to see
- [55:45] this is it if all this is if everything
- [55:47] I'm saying is true and there's these
- [55:48] limits and stuff because of cancellation
- [55:50] then there should be no way to get a big
- [55:52] company like a public SAS company Unless
- [55:55] NR is greater than 100, like otherwise
- [55:57] cancellation should just win. And that
- [55:59] is in fact the case. There's over a
- [56:01] hundred SAS public companies and
- [56:04] something like two of them have NR less
- [56:06] than 100%.
- [56:07] Like that's how it goes. And those
- [56:09] companies have horrible financials and
- [56:11] their values valuations are are bad.
- [56:13] Like it's not good. It's not a good
- [56:15] thing, right? So, and in fact the median
- [56:18] for a IPOed SAS company like at IPO the
- [56:22] median NR is 119%.
- [56:27] So that's so yes that's what it takes.
- [56:29] You can't do this. You're limited in
- [56:31] less. Now your your goal may or may not
- [56:33] be to get that big but the point being
- [56:35] it's mandatory for growth. Now if the
- [56:38] literal customers are just leaving like
- [56:40] you know that you got to you got to plug
- [56:42] that hole first like you said. But okay,
- [56:43] if they're okay, that's why this is in
- [56:45] order. If that's generally okay, now we
- [56:48] turn to NR to say, okay, but the ones
- [56:50] who stay, they're hopefully happy. They
- [56:52] need to grow. Okay, so that's the kind
- [56:53] of the full story of NR. I think people
- [56:55] don't quite people who've heard of NR
- [56:58] don't necessarily think about all those
- [56:59] things and realize that. So a good
- [57:02] question is, okay, what do I do with NR?
- [57:06] But I think the answers are pretty clear
- [57:08] like you add features, you have
- [57:10] different tiers, you change the pricing
- [57:12] in some way uh with usage or seats or
- [57:15] something that kind of goes up
- [57:16] automatically as they get more value out
- [57:17] of it. So I I don't think that's
- [57:19] terribly interesting to like double
- [57:21] click into. It's it's sort of obvious. I
- [57:23] would say oh look it's tied into pricing
- [57:25] because their behavior. But the main
- [57:27] thing is you want it to so to where the
- [57:30] customer themselves would agree when
- [57:32] they pay more that they are getting more
- [57:34] value. Hopefully, they even think
- [57:36] they're getting far more value than the
- [57:38] price going up, right? That I'm I'm I'm
- [57:41] gonna say this as if it's precise, which
- [57:42] it's not. But they need to feel like if
- [57:44] the price doubles, yeah, but I'm getting
- [57:46] five times the value, so that's fine.
- [57:48] Like that should be the feeling whether
- [57:49] they can measure it or not. A a good way
- [57:51] to do that is to say, well, then you
- [57:53] should be measuring whether they're
- [57:54] getting value out of it. Often we
- [57:56] measure like usage metrics and other
- [57:58] kinds of metrics within our product
- [57:59] because we can. But actually what's
- [58:02] really important is to measure how does
- [58:04] the customer value this and we need to
- [58:08] measure that so that we make that go up
- [58:11] because if we make that go up they'll be
- [58:13] willing to pay in whatever structure.
- [58:15] And if that isn't going up they won't be
- [58:18] willing to pay. So even if we start
- [58:19] making them they'll leave. And we all
- [58:22] know we've all probably done it
- [58:23] ourselves. We've all had products we
- [58:24] love, but then as we scale, the price
- [58:26] goes up faster than we feel the value
- [58:28] is, and then we start looking for other
- [58:29] products. Like we've all experienced
- [58:31] that. So that's what I'm saying. To do
- [58:33] that, you want some sort of measure of
- [58:35] the value the customer is getting. If
- [58:37] you're really lucky, that can be a
- [58:38] number. That would be wonderful. Then go
- [58:41] do that and maybe that's your northstar.
- [58:43] But um admittedly, it's not always
- [58:45] possible. So then the question is the
- [58:47] usual questions of metrics. Are there
- [58:48] proxy metrics that we understand?
- [58:50] They're not the full picture, but
- [58:51] they're helpful. they're part of the you
- [58:53] know um and and I'm a big believer in
- [58:55] saying not all important things are
- [58:57] numbers I mean even things like how
- [58:59] differentiated are we in the market not
- [59:00] a number but it's very important so this
- [59:03] might be one of those things that's
- [59:04] important but not not a number so okay
- [59:06] can we get some proxy metrics even of
- [59:08] behavior other things that's something
- [59:11] um something better than some metric
- [59:13] that's you know just operational and
- [59:15] even if it's qualitative okay can we do
- [59:18] that can we talk to customers and ask
- [59:20] them qualitative questions to try to say
- [59:22] like you know I would just say like do
- [59:24] your best here because only when you
- [59:28] generate more value for the customer you
- [59:29] can then decide how to split that with
- [59:31] the customer in terms of things like
- [59:33] price you know right um but that's
- [59:35] that's my um that's in fact how I think
- [59:37] of it that very phrase how do we create
- [59:40] more value for the customer and then
- [59:41] split that with them and when you do
- [59:43] that you're keeping the customer
- [59:46] forefront in mind you are taking some
- [59:47] like splitting means you get some like
- [59:49] like let's not forget it's not a charity
- [59:52] and on the other hand first we should
- [59:54] think how are we generating value for
- [59:55] customers and then think and then we can
- [59:57] take a little we've now earned the
- [59:58] ability to take a little piece of that
- [01:00:00] so to me this is the right way to think
- [01:00:01] about NRR not just we'll add a feature
- [01:00:03] and make them pay true but let's
- [01:00:06] actually take it from this different
- [01:00:07] let's get there from this different
- [01:00:08] perspective
- [01:00:10] >> amazing there's uh in the recent modavon
- [01:00:13] episode where we go into pricing you
- [01:00:14] actually have some really good tactical
- [01:00:15] advice for measuring the value that
- [01:00:17] you're giving to a company to quantify
- [01:00:19] that uh which feeds into this idea of
- [01:00:22] how do I create more value for you and
- [01:00:23] then how do we split it?
- [01:00:24] >> Yeah.
- [01:00:25] >> The other element of this that's top of
- [01:00:27] mind is just this land and expand
- [01:00:28] strategy. There's a lot of companies
- [01:00:30] that are just like okay cool we'll get
- [01:00:32] in with some price we'll expand that'll
- [01:00:33] be amazing which is essentially
- [01:00:35] expanding is NR going above 100%. Yes.
- [01:00:37] Something Jen actually shared on her in
- [01:00:39] her chat that was really important is
- [01:00:41] that you can't expand that much in ter
- [01:00:44] at least for a while because if you get
- [01:00:46] in for like 10k uh if you go up to okay
- [01:00:49] now it's 100k someone's going to be like
- [01:00:50] what is this why is this can't go up 10x
- [01:00:53] are we getting 10x value from this you
- [01:00:54] can't just raise prices later you're
- [01:00:56] kind of stuck at that reference point so
- [01:00:57] you have to be really careful there.
- [01:00:58] Yeah, I think that's right. Um, and
- [01:01:01] maybe you don't deserve it. Like, in
- [01:01:02] other words,
- [01:01:04] especially when there's investors or
- [01:01:06] other sort of forces saying like, "Hey,
- [01:01:08] we need a x, y, and z." The forces that
- [01:01:11] are not the customer saying that um
- [01:01:13] yeah, we you can you can be you can be
- [01:01:17] coerced into making pricing or other
- [01:01:20] kinds of policies that in fact are not
- [01:01:23] good for the customer. So, so one one uh
- [01:01:25] tool I use uh is when when anyone claims
- [01:01:29] anything really is is is that really
- [01:01:33] true or is that really actually good for
- [01:01:34] the customer? Because look, we are going
- [01:01:36] to do things that are selfishly good for
- [01:01:37] us. We have to we can't just do things
- [01:01:39] that are bad for us. But but is this in
- [01:01:42] fact good for the customer? Because
- [01:01:44] often often even in an internal
- [01:01:46] proposal, we say it as if it is. Oh,
- [01:01:48] this pricing will be good. It'll raise
- [01:01:50] prices on everyone, but it's better
- [01:01:51] because of this reason that we we're
- [01:01:53] sort of justifying, right? It's like,
- [01:01:55] well, is it will the customer say this
- [01:01:57] is better? If the answer is no, it's
- [01:02:00] like, okay, it's not it's better for us,
- [01:02:02] but sorry, we have an equation where it
- [01:02:04] has to be better for us and better for
- [01:02:05] the customer. Sorry, it's an AMP, you
- [01:02:07] know, and of course, not all companies
- [01:02:09] do that. And we and we experience that
- [01:02:10] on all of us um as as consumers on the
- [01:02:13] other end of that, and we don't like it.
- [01:02:15] and and that's not a good long-term
- [01:02:16] strategy even though it might work in
- [01:02:18] the short term as many bad long-term
- [01:02:20] strategies are.
- [01:02:21] >> I love just how uh this third step just
- [01:02:23] reveals how powerful the sequence is
- [01:02:26] that we're going through. Step one is
- [01:02:28] this logo retention essentially do we
- [01:02:30] have product market fit? Step two is
- [01:02:33] pricing positioning essentially are we
- [01:02:35] going after the right market and
- [01:02:36] charging them the right amount roughly.
- [01:02:39] And then here it's just can we can we
- [01:02:41] grow? Is there something here that can
- [01:02:44] continue to expand because you're going
- [01:02:45] to get eaten alive if you're especially
- [01:02:47] and this is just to be clear this is B2B
- [01:02:48] SAS primarily that we're talking about
- [01:02:50] here. It's harder to grow an or if
- [01:02:53] you're consumer product that has I don't
- [01:02:54] know just like a tier two.
- [01:02:55] >> What what I would say is the the rules
- [01:02:57] are true everywhere because they're
- [01:02:59] based in the mechanics of finance in the
- [01:03:01] business.
- [01:03:03] >> Now you are right that a cons that in
- [01:03:04] the consumer segment or small business
- [01:03:06] segment for that matter um they tend not
- [01:03:08] to grow.
- [01:03:10] So that doesn't mean the NR question is
- [01:03:12] invalid. It means dang, we can't think
- [01:03:14] of anything.
- [01:03:16] >> That's okay. Then you go on to the next
- [01:03:18] question because you can't think of
- [01:03:19] anything. But you know, but it would be
- [01:03:22] more strategic if we could.
- [01:03:24] >> Mhm. Yeah.
- [01:03:25] >> And are we trying hard enough? As a
- [01:03:28] consumer, I do not want to spend more
- [01:03:29] with AT&T, but they're also not giving
- [01:03:31] me any more value.
- [01:03:33] >> But there are other products as a
- [01:03:34] consumer like Amazon where they do. So
- [01:03:38] you're right, but it would be as a
- [01:03:40] product manager, it would be 10 times
- [01:03:42] more valuable for you to think of
- [01:03:44] something like that, you know, than to
- [01:03:47] move on to other things and etc. Or
- [01:03:49] there's other ways like other products
- [01:03:51] like we didn't talk about it and it's
- [01:03:52] okay because of course each one of these
- [01:03:53] is you could go on forever, right? But
- [01:03:55] another way is a second product.
- [01:03:58] A second product sold to the same
- [01:04:00] segments that you're in so that your
- [01:04:02] existing customers can buy it. Well, I
- [01:04:04] don't know why that wouldn't work in
- [01:04:05] consumer. It certainly works in consumer
- [01:04:08] and apparel.
- [01:04:09] >> I think about AG1 which has all these
- [01:04:10] new like I'm doing their sleep uh
- [01:04:12] supplement and there it goes. They're
- [01:04:13] just like here's a new thing you can
- [01:04:15] buy.
- [01:04:15] >> Yeah.
- [01:04:16] >> So like like so is it harder? Yeah. Of
- [01:04:18] course. Of course. Like all of these are
- [01:04:19] like easier or harder in different
- [01:04:21] segments and ways like of course of
- [01:04:22] course. I'm not trying to say otherwise.
- [01:04:24] >> I but I would say the mechanics of how
- [01:04:26] the finances work is the same. You're
- [01:04:29] just saying I don't have this lever to
- [01:04:30] pull. And then I would say okay then you
- [01:04:32] need different levers. Um, one that we
- [01:04:35] didn't talk about, um, is one way to
- [01:04:39] offset the cancellations is existing
- [01:04:42] customers grow. But another way is if
- [01:04:44] existing customers bring in new
- [01:04:46] customers. So they didn't grow, but they
- [01:04:49] brought their friend. Now this is
- [01:04:50] absolutely something that happens in
- [01:04:52] consumer. But it's also an answer to
- [01:04:54] this thing where cancellations grow
- [01:04:56] exponentially. You know, because
- [01:04:58] existing customers bring in new does
- [01:05:00] triple if you have more existing
- [01:05:02] customers. Aha. So this is stuff like um
- [01:05:05] you know refer a friend and all this
- [01:05:06] kind of stuff. Again like some of this
- [01:05:07] is is obvious. We don't need to
- [01:05:08] enumerate that but uh so so those things
- [01:05:11] are good. And so in consumer you might
- [01:05:13] say oh it's easier to try to get someone
- [01:05:15] to invite a friend with a coupon and
- [01:05:17] blah blah blah blah than it is to try to
- [01:05:18] get them to grow. But in B2B that may
- [01:05:20] not be true, right? I don't get a
- [01:05:21] mid-size company to refer. Like that
- [01:05:23] doesn't make sense. So, so once again,
- [01:05:26] this question of how do we have the
- [01:05:27] existing base help us grow is still
- [01:05:30] correct in consumer but its
- [01:05:32] manifestation could be very different.
- [01:05:33] Of course, I agree with that. But um I
- [01:05:36] mean how could how could we not say I
- [01:05:37] mean of course things like word of mouth
- [01:05:38] and inviting friend of course that's
- [01:05:40] enormous with consumer and this is this
- [01:05:42] is one of the reasons why
- [01:05:43] >> I'm uh I just love picturing the people
- [01:05:45] listening to this especially product
- [01:05:47] folks founders I I imagine many of them
- [01:05:49] are just sitting here taking all these
- [01:05:51] notes of how to help grow their product
- [01:05:53] because as this is we've positioned this
- [01:05:55] conversation as how to uh deal with
- [01:05:57] stalled growth but it's actually just as
- [01:06:00] useful how do I grow more
- [01:06:01] >> oh for sure right right it's more growth
- [01:06:04] It's just maybe a little more evocative.
- [01:06:07] >> It's It's because if growth is good,
- [01:06:09] yeah, sure you want to grow more, but
- [01:06:10] it's not the problem.
- [01:06:12] >> Like if growth is really good, the
- [01:06:13] problem is generally operationally
- [01:06:15] scaling to meet the growth. Uh and so
- [01:06:17] you're focused on that. It's when growth
- [01:06:19] slows, you're like, whoa, wait, wait,
- [01:06:21] wait, wait. Right. We we have to focus
- [01:06:24] on growth now. Must as opposed to of
- [01:06:26] course it's always nice. So yeah.
- [01:06:28] >> Yeah. And I was thinking as we were
- [01:06:29] talking about consumer NR, if you look
- [01:06:32] at Duelingo, they've done a great job
- [01:06:33] here. There's so many ways you can pay
- [01:06:35] them more for all these little
- [01:06:36] >> advances. Get all these gems. Change the
- [01:06:38] color of your app to like something
- [01:06:40] fancy.
- [01:06:41] >> Yeah. Yeah.
- [01:06:41] >> Yeah. Okay. So, there's more. Let's keep
- [01:06:44] going. So, we've done three. There's
- [01:06:45] more more you can do.
- [01:06:47] >> So, okay. Logo churn. Um uh uh
- [01:06:51] >> pricing
- [01:06:51] >> pricing
- [01:06:52] >> NR and then maybe it's stalled. So, this
- [01:06:56] is really a stalled question. Maybe your
- [01:06:58] acquisition channels, your marketing
- [01:06:59] channels are saturated. We're done. I
- [01:07:03] mean, we're what we tend to do is flog
- [01:07:05] the people doing AdWords, get more flog
- [01:07:07] the SEO people, get more searches,
- [01:07:09] right? It's possible that this is it.
- [01:07:13] Maybe this is it in some sort of
- [01:07:15] physical law. There literally isn't
- [01:07:17] anything else. Or maybe this is it just
- [01:07:19] this is how good we can be. We're just
- [01:07:21] not this is it, right? But there really
- [01:07:24] are limits. You know, they it's there's
- [01:07:26] different words for it. Inventory is is
- [01:07:28] sort of the old word like with magazine
- [01:07:29] ads. uh inventory was the word, but
- [01:07:31] there's just this amount like there is
- [01:07:33] only so many searches in your area and
- [01:07:35] you can only appear once in the search
- [01:07:37] results for a given keyword. So there is
- [01:07:40] this limit of like what you can get.
- [01:07:41] Even if you were number one position for
- [01:07:43] everything, you know, other things that
- [01:07:44] are that are not even practical, uh
- [01:07:46] there's still a limit and there's some
- [01:07:47] kind of practical limit that's below
- [01:07:48] there that we we don't really know. But,
- [01:07:50] you know, maybe we're there or maybe
- [01:07:52] we're close. And worse, channels tend to
- [01:07:55] decline over time. So, I think people
- [01:07:57] talk about S-curves, right? Oh, I uh I
- [01:08:01] didn't figure out this market, then I
- [01:08:03] figured it out. You know, we we we we
- [01:08:04] unlocked it. Now, we're getting, you
- [01:08:06] know, 100 leads per month through
- [01:08:07] Facebook or whatever. But then it kind
- [01:08:09] of taps out and then we go into this
- [01:08:11] optimization mode. Can we ek out another
- [01:08:14] blah blah blah blah, which is right,
- [01:08:15] that's right. And you call that an
- [01:08:17] S-curve because it's shaped like that.
- [01:08:19] But that's not what happens. What
- [01:08:21] happens is it starts with an S-curve and
- [01:08:22] then it starts sagging. Its butt starts
- [01:08:25] sagging down. So, I wrote an article
- [01:08:26] about this called the elephant curve,
- [01:08:28] which is what I named it, right? Because
- [01:08:31] it's like this trunk and then but then
- [01:08:32] it's this butt. And what and and there's
- [01:08:35] different reasons why this happens, but
- [01:08:37] if you talk to any marketer, they'll
- [01:08:38] they'll all tell you, "Oh my god, let me
- [01:08:40] tell you this story, right? They all
- [01:08:42] have stories about it because yeah, this
- [01:08:43] is what happens." Um there's different
- [01:08:45] reasons that um first of all, the the
- [01:08:46] audience gets saturated, you know,
- [01:08:49] because there's all these little
- [01:08:50] marketing isms and I don't know if
- [01:08:51] they're true or not. I don't I don't
- [01:08:52] think any of it has any data that
- [01:08:54] actually proves it, but whatever. Like,
- [01:08:56] you know, if worms if words uh start
- [01:08:59] with the same letter, that's better. I
- [01:09:02] don't think I don't think anyone's ever
- [01:09:03] proved that's true, but marketers seem
- [01:09:05] to think so. Okay. Well, one of the
- [01:09:06] things is someone has to see it seven
- [01:09:08] times before they act. Okay. All right.
- [01:09:10] Well, maybe they saw it seven times
- [01:09:12] already, so they don't want it, you
- [01:09:14] know, or they saw it 20 times, right?
- [01:09:16] So, so, so you you initially you got you
- [01:09:18] hit people who hadn't seen it yet,
- [01:09:19] right? But now you have and you know
- [01:09:22] especially with magazine ads as I used
- [01:09:24] to do before there was no such thing. Um
- [01:09:27] that's exactly what would happen. You'd
- [01:09:29] have this nice surge and then like well
- [01:09:30] we've seen this we've seen it before. So
- [01:09:31] you still get a little trick. You still
- [01:09:33] get some because you know it was just
- [01:09:34] that moment they needed to see it again.
- [01:09:36] Okay but like there's this sort of um
- [01:09:39] but a lot of people have already seen it
- [01:09:40] and they don't want it or the channel is
- [01:09:42] declining and they'll never tell you.
- [01:09:45] When I did magazine ads, every year they
- [01:09:47] would tell you what their circulation
- [01:09:48] is, and every year it would go up and
- [01:09:49] then the magazine would go out of
- [01:09:50] business. Conferences are the same way.
- [01:09:54] Attendance is great. Attendance is
- [01:09:55] great. Oh, wait. We're out of business
- [01:09:56] because we couldn't get enough people to
- [01:09:57] come. What? What they said? It was
- [01:09:59] great. And but at but you know, more
- [01:10:02] quietly, Adwords, Facebook ads, even SEO
- [01:10:05] searches, it's this does happen all over
- [01:10:08] the place. Affiliates, it can happen.
- [01:10:11] And now with AI, I mean, I don't even
- [01:10:12] know, right? It's disrupting everything.
- [01:10:15] I, you know, we've all heard stories
- [01:10:17] going all different directions. I think
- [01:10:18] the answer is I don't know. Shrug is the
- [01:10:21] answer. And what will it be like in two
- [01:10:23] years? Another shrug. But the point
- [01:10:25] being they're not all they're not all
- [01:10:26] going to be growing a lot. Like that's
- [01:10:28] not that's not one of the futures that
- [01:10:30] AI will bring. So it has this sag.
- [01:10:33] That's just a very long way of maybe
- [01:10:34] trying to prove this point. But it's yet
- [01:10:36] another reason why you can't just rely
- [01:10:38] on marketing forever because they not
- [01:10:40] only you try to stack things, but
- [01:10:42] there's not like infinite number of
- [01:10:43] marketing channels you could advertise
- [01:10:44] in that your customers are actually
- [01:10:46] going to and they sag. Oh no. Like it's
- [01:10:49] even harder to keep up. So it's kind of
- [01:10:51] like the secret like reinforcing my very
- [01:10:54] first point here with with this. But
- [01:10:56] here are they all saturated because we
- [01:10:58] could fogg marketing all we want. It's
- [01:11:00] not going to work. So maybe growth is
- [01:11:01] slowing because this is all our channels
- [01:11:04] are saturated. possibly even sagging,
- [01:11:06] but even if not, okay, not growing. And
- [01:11:09] so, we can't just flog the marketing
- [01:11:11] department.
- [01:11:12] It's going to take something else,
- [01:11:14] right? Um, then the obvious thing is get
- [01:11:17] more channels, but again, maybe there
- [01:11:18] aren't any. So, again, there there's
- [01:11:21] many possible things to do, but this is
- [01:11:23] like this critical thing to notice
- [01:11:24] because I guess I would put it this way.
- [01:11:26] Do you know right now which channels are
- [01:11:28] saturated and which aren't? If the
- [01:11:30] answer is no, I'm like, well, okay,
- [01:11:32] maybe that's because the answer is all.
- [01:11:35] You know, that needs to change what you
- [01:11:37] how you think. Just adding one little
- [01:11:39] feature and then hoping we can flog
- [01:11:40] Adwords is not going to work. Even if
- [01:11:43] the feature is great, not going to work.
- [01:11:45] So there's there's different things that
- [01:11:47] could work, but that's not one of them.
- [01:11:48] And yet, that's probably what we're
- [01:11:49] doing. Let's add another feature and
- [01:11:50] marketing can fogg it is is often the
- [01:11:53] answer. But if you're in this state,
- [01:11:54] that isn't the answer. So this is this
- [01:11:56] is why like you could say it's obvious
- [01:11:58] to say this or that but if but are are
- [01:12:00] you acting like this is true
- [01:12:02] you know often we don't um okay so so
- [01:12:05] there are many things to do again we
- [01:12:06] don't have to enumerate all of them or
- [01:12:08] something um it's just simply the right
- [01:12:10] question to ask but for example uh some
- [01:12:12] people are like um we've done direct
- [01:12:15] maybe we should try things like SEO and
- [01:12:17] social and these other indirects or vice
- [01:12:18] versa we're really good at SEO but we've
- [01:12:20] never taken out ads often if you've done
- [01:12:22] ads and they're optimized you know what
- [01:12:24] content might be good to write stuff for
- [01:12:26] SEO and maybe even vice versa maybe. So,
- [01:12:29] it's a good idea and sometimes it works,
- [01:12:32] but here I have no data. I only have my
- [01:12:34] my feeling here and actually you
- [01:12:36] probably have a lot more visibility into
- [01:12:38] this, but my experience is a product
- [01:12:40] that's sold really well direct actually
- [01:12:42] doesn't do well in things like social
- [01:12:43] and SEO and vice versa. If you're
- [01:12:46] getting a lot of traffic through SEO,
- [01:12:47] adding ads often like costs a lot and
- [01:12:49] doesn't really move the needle. like you
- [01:12:51] can tell me like is that because I don't
- [01:12:52] have data to support that that theory.
- [01:12:55] >> Yeah, my take is like you can always get
- [01:12:57] some percentage of win from all these
- [01:12:59] different channels. Usually one channel
- [01:13:01] is where most of your growth will come
- [01:13:03] from and so over time everyone just adds
- [01:13:05] every channel. Everyone's doing ads.
- [01:13:06] Everyone's doing SEO in some form. But
- [01:13:09] it's usually like sales or word of mouth
- [01:13:11] or ads that drives everything.
- [01:13:13] Everything else is kind of like little
- [01:13:14] layer on top.
- [01:13:15] >> Yeah. So, you know, should you do that?
- [01:13:17] Yeah, probably. especially if you're at
- [01:13:19] some scale and you can just afford to
- [01:13:20] because it's such a clear thing to do.
- [01:13:22] But probably you'll have to get more
- [01:13:24] creative about what it means to add a
- [01:13:25] channel or something like a new product
- [01:13:28] or a new market where it's it's it's
- [01:13:30] actually new. It's expanding in a new
- [01:13:32] way rather than trying to incrementally
- [01:13:34] expand what you're already doing. So an
- [01:13:36] example of getting creative on a channel
- [01:13:39] is what Constant Contact did when they
- [01:13:41] had this very problem of growth is slow.
- [01:13:44] We don't know how we sell email
- [01:13:46] marketing newsletters to small business
- [01:13:48] before all these modern tools existed.
- [01:13:50] And one of the things they did that
- [01:13:52] restarted growth is they physically went
- [01:13:55] to a bunch of cities and held workshops
- [01:13:57] showing here's how to do email marketing
- [01:13:59] for your small business. So the
- [01:14:01] restaurant tour and the dentist and
- [01:14:03] every would come to these sessions and
- [01:14:05] they teach them how of course teaching
- [01:14:06] them how with constant contact. So they
- [01:14:07] became customers, right? that you would
- [01:14:09] think there's no way this is
- [01:14:10] cost-effective physically being in these
- [01:14:13] cities and dragging people in for a you
- [01:14:15] know $20 a month product like no way. It
- [01:14:17] was very effective and actually solved
- [01:14:19] in that moment their their restarted
- [01:14:21] growth. They were very clever about
- [01:14:24] first of all it's a clever idea but then
- [01:14:25] they were clever about how to do it.
- [01:14:26] They took like power users who were also
- [01:14:28] agencies. So like these could become
- [01:14:30] customers of their okay all like you
- [01:14:32] could be clever about like how is it
- [01:14:34] that we do something uh something
- [01:14:36] different something new. So that's
- [01:14:37] possible. Of course, it's always hard to
- [01:14:38] say, "Think of something clever." That's
- [01:14:40] that's a weird finger wagging thing to
- [01:14:42] do, but okay, it's true. But, uh, yeah,
- [01:14:45] it it could be a different type of
- [01:14:46] channel. For example, um, HubSpot
- [01:14:48] famously, uh, tested selling through
- [01:14:52] agencies instead of direct. It ended up
- [01:14:53] being 50% of the revenue after four or
- [01:14:56] five years. So, it's one of the main
- [01:14:57] reasons why they're able to continue
- [01:14:58] growing. Um, same thing happens with my
- [01:15:02] company, WP Engine. Tons of our uh
- [01:15:04] websites are sold through
- [01:15:07] uh uh agencies that create WordPress
- [01:15:08] sites. So um there could be something
- [01:15:11] that's not direct anymore that's you
- [01:15:13] know another channel of human beings or
- [01:15:14] something like that could be could could
- [01:15:16] in fact dramatically change your growth
- [01:15:19] rate. U there's lots of examples like
- [01:15:20] those. So but but it could be like it's
- [01:15:24] time for the next product like and I
- [01:15:25] said that earlier because it's always
- [01:15:27] possible. Of course we all know that's
- [01:15:28] very hard. It's it's risky. I have sort
- [01:15:31] of a framework that I use to think about
- [01:15:33] that kind of expansion which I'm happy
- [01:15:35] to happy to provide. I've also written
- [01:15:37] it up but I'm happy to say it right
- [01:15:38] here. But uh usually you want to stay in
- [01:15:42] the target in the target market you're
- [01:15:44] already good at and grow from there. But
- [01:15:47] sometimes the whole point of the
- [01:15:48] expansion is to change the or change
- [01:15:50] target m or add something where you're
- [01:15:53] leveraging something else about the
- [01:15:54] company that you have as an asset going
- [01:15:56] somewhere else. So this is what this
- [01:15:57] framework helps decide. But um one way
- [01:15:59] or another you probably want to uh plant
- [01:16:01] one foot into some strength or asset
- [01:16:03] that you have move the other foot which
- [01:16:05] is the risky Bart but the idea is that
- [01:16:07] yeah well we have this big upside so
- [01:16:09] we're we're taking that bet and like
- [01:16:10] that becomes a smart bet. Um so with
- [01:16:13] things of course that's true for any of
- [01:16:16] these things but especially if
- [01:16:17] acquisition channels are full and it's
- [01:16:20] like we literally can't ask the
- [01:16:21] marketing department like that's just
- [01:16:22] not one of the choices. It almost forces
- [01:16:24] us to start taking these more drastic
- [01:16:26] bets to say, "Well, we got to do
- [01:16:27] something and that's not one of them."
- [01:16:29] >> I just want to keep saying how awesome
- [01:16:31] this advice is and how many people are
- [01:16:33] going to benefit from like, you know,
- [01:16:35] none of this is like, "Oh, I've never
- [01:16:36] ever thought of any of this." It's just
- [01:16:38] like the very methodical uh sequence of
- [01:16:41] questions you should be asking yourself
- [01:16:43] to help you not just undo stalled
- [01:16:46] growth, but also just come up with a
- [01:16:47] bunch of great growth ideas. And this
- [01:16:50] specific section, it like it makes
- [01:16:51] sense. somebody's discovered alpha in a
- [01:16:53] growth channel. Say, uh, SAPI just
- [01:16:56] launched. Tik Tok just, you know,
- [01:16:57] there's like, oh, cool. What's the new
- [01:16:58] thing? Okay, let's get there quick. And
- [01:17:00] then you drive a bunch of growth. It's
- [01:17:01] awesome. Eventually, everyone's going to
- [01:17:03] start doing that. And so, you should
- [01:17:04] assume everything that is working for
- [01:17:06] you now will slow down. Uh, I've never
- [01:17:09] uh I've missed your post on the the
- [01:17:11] elephant uh scurve. What do you call it?
- [01:17:14] The elephant curve.
- [01:17:15] >> Yeah, elephant curve.
- [01:17:16] >> It's so Yeah, that's so real. just it's
- [01:17:18] not just this S-curve that will forever
- [01:17:20] continue to drive win. It will actually
- [01:17:22] dip and decline over time because other
- [01:17:24] people discover it and start using it.
- [01:17:26] >> Yeah,
- [01:17:27] >> I love that. So, the idea here is and
- [01:17:30] the classic advice is like not whether
- [01:17:33] it's an S-curve or an Lin curve, think
- [01:17:36] about are you starting to approach the
- [01:17:37] the the apex of that and start to
- [01:17:40] explore other channels before you slow
- [01:17:42] down or start to dip. Yeah, it's easy to
- [01:17:44] hear stuff like, "Oh, if marketing is is
- [01:17:47] full, do something else." And you go, "I
- [01:17:49] know." But then you look at people's
- [01:17:50] behavior and it's like, "Well, you're
- [01:17:52] not acting like you know, you know, so
- [01:17:55] maybe what needs to be said in enough
- [01:17:57] detail that you actually do something
- [01:17:58] about it."
- [01:17:59] >> And this is it's important to note this
- [01:18:00] is a very hard problem. Most companies
- [01:18:02] do not really solve this. They something
- [01:18:04] worked for them.
- [01:18:05] >> Sure.
- [01:18:05] >> And then it stops working and then like,
- [01:18:07] "All right, well, we found something and
- [01:18:09] then it just kind of went away." There's
- [01:18:12] a couple posts we're going to link to in
- [01:18:13] the show notes that will help you come
- [01:18:14] up with ideas that are all around new
- [01:18:16] growth channels that are emerging. One
- [01:18:18] is by Emily Kramer around ecosystems as
- [01:18:21] a new growth channel. And there's a lot
- [01:18:22] of really cool advice there around this
- [01:18:24] kind of emerging combination of
- [01:18:27] influencers and content and partners
- [01:18:31] where it's your ecosystem that helps
- [01:18:33] grow. Basically, there's a quote from
- [01:18:35] the head of growth at Whiz where it's
- [01:18:37] like, "Why start with zero when you can
- [01:18:39] start with 10,000 essentially growing
- [01:18:41] through someone with an audience
- [01:18:42] already?" And then there's going to be a
- [01:18:44] post out by the time this comes out
- [01:18:45] around Chad GPT's app store, which is
- [01:18:48] going to let you submit apps. And that's
- [01:18:50] a really interesting, potentially huge
- [01:18:52] new growth channel for companies. So,
- [01:18:54] cool stuff happening there. So just to
- [01:18:56] summarize logo retention, pricing, NRR,
- [01:19:01] marketing, channel saturation, what
- [01:19:03] comes next? The last question is, do you
- [01:19:06] need to grow?
- [01:19:08] So okay, growth is stalled. And if we
- [01:19:10] assume every question before has been
- [01:19:12] answered in a satisfactory way,
- [01:19:16] you could ask, hey, is that a problem?
- [01:19:20] What do we mean by grow? What do we need
- [01:19:23] to do exactly? Now of course you should
- [01:19:25] know these kind of things with goals all
- [01:19:26] the time but
- [01:19:29] and again like obviously the answer
- [01:19:30] could be once again oh new products
- [01:19:32] these other things where like this
- [01:19:34] company when we say do you need to grow
- [01:19:36] if we define you as this product in this
- [01:19:38] market in this company the answer might
- [01:19:40] be no what what we need to do is have a
- [01:19:43] different product or in a different
- [01:19:45] market or a different thing or you could
- [01:19:48] you could change the word uh revenue if
- [01:19:49] you say do you need to grow revenue you
- [01:19:51] could change the word revenue and say
- [01:19:52] you know But what we could do is
- [01:19:55] maximize profit instead of revenue now.
- [01:19:58] We've been maximizing revenue, but maybe
- [01:20:00] we maximize profit instead. And so this
- [01:20:02] is a company like 37 Signals or really
- [01:20:05] lots of bootstrap companies who have hit
- [01:20:07] some sort of limit and realize that's
- [01:20:09] okay. Like the founders are getting paid
- [01:20:10] millions of dollars a year in dividends
- [01:20:12] and like it's okay.
- [01:20:14] I don't have to get in fact if I got
- [01:20:16] bigger it might be an organization that
- [01:20:18] I don't like or serving a market segment
- [01:20:20] that I don't want to serve or whatever.
- [01:20:22] Um, and so maybe maybe growing forever
- [01:20:25] isn't the goal actually or growing
- [01:20:27] revenue isn't. Um, you could ask
- [01:20:30] philosophically,
- [01:20:32] why grow anything? Why isn't it just
- [01:20:34] okay to have stasis? And we all have
- [01:20:36] heard the phrase, if you're not growing,
- [01:20:37] you're dying,
- [01:20:39] right? This is a classic company thing.
- [01:20:42] Is that true or is that the kind of
- [01:20:44] thing that like investors use to like
- [01:20:46] make founders grow or try to grow even
- [01:20:48] when they shouldn't?
- [01:20:50] It might be, but I would submit that
- [01:20:53] even at a bootstrap company that has
- [01:20:55] other values and culture um other than
- [01:20:57] growth at all costs that that phrase is
- [01:21:00] still fairly relevant because if the
- [01:21:03] company's stagnant for years, is that a
- [01:21:06] great environment for everyone as the
- [01:21:09] founder? Did you start this company in
- [01:21:11] order to do the same thing every day? Is
- [01:21:14] that is that why you did it? Do you
- [01:21:16] really want to do is that fulfilling for
- [01:21:18] you? What about everyone else? Nobody
- [01:21:21] Nobody wants to further their career.
- [01:21:22] They just want to do the same thing
- [01:21:23] every day and never further their
- [01:21:24] career, not really learn anything, not
- [01:21:26] really innovate. Does it feel good to
- [01:21:29] just not be not not be growing? The
- [01:21:32] answer could be yes. Uh, you know, if
- [01:21:34] I'm a CPA and I have some clients and
- [01:21:36] life is good. Um, the answer could be
- [01:21:38] yes. Like, you know, I'm not saying I'm
- [01:21:40] not dictating the answer here, right?
- [01:21:42] I'm just asking because a lot of times
- [01:21:45] whether it's our careers or as founders,
- [01:21:47] our companies, a lot of times we've just
- [01:21:50] been in the mode of I've got to grow,
- [01:21:52] I've got to get promoted, I've got to do
- [01:21:54] more, I've got my resume. We've got in
- [01:21:55] that mode for so long, like maybe our
- [01:21:57] whole life that I was going to say lose
- [01:22:00] sight of, but maybe we never had sight
- [01:22:02] of, wait, does this make me happy? Is
- [01:22:04] this what I really want? Am I fulfilled
- [01:22:06] doing this? or even if I do have these
- [01:22:08] goals, have I gotten stuck in a rut
- [01:22:10] where my goal is growth and you know, I
- [01:22:12] don't know, more money, more everything
- [01:22:13] and I'm but I'm stuck in a rut here like
- [01:22:15] what sometimes we forget to take a step
- [01:22:17] back and go, wait a minute, what is
- [01:22:19] this? Is this still right or do I need
- [01:22:21] to turn the page and have a new chapter
- [01:22:23] of life right now, you know? And so this
- [01:22:27] question, do do you need to grow or if
- [01:22:29] you're not growing, you're dying. Well,
- [01:22:31] for some people, no, they like doing the
- [01:22:32] same thing forever. And and and that's
- [01:22:34] great actually. That's a that's a that's
- [01:22:36] nice. But for many people, especially
- [01:22:38] the kind of people who want to get into
- [01:22:40] product and build stuff and innovate and
- [01:22:43] people who start companies, a lot of
- [01:22:44] people like that are not the kind of
- [01:22:46] people that want to just, you know, kind
- [01:22:47] of do wrote things for 20 years. And so
- [01:22:52] the not growing part, what I like to say
- [01:22:54] is maybe the you and if you are not
- [01:22:58] growing, you're dying is you the person
- [01:23:00] as opposed to you the company. It's also
- [01:23:02] you the company, right? But like what if
- [01:23:04] we took it to mean you? If you are not
- [01:23:07] growing, then in some sense maybe for
- [01:23:10] some people you're dying. Maybe if
- [01:23:12] you're listening to this, that's you.
- [01:23:13] You got to you're a shark and you got to
- [01:23:15] go. And we all know people too who claim
- [01:23:18] they hate work or maybe they do hate
- [01:23:20] work. Let's not say claim they do hate
- [01:23:22] work, but then they retire and and and
- [01:23:24] kind of go downhill because they don't
- [01:23:25] have a purpose or this or that and the
- [01:23:27] other thing. In that case, it was true.
- [01:23:31] If they're not growing, they're dying.
- [01:23:32] literally.
- [01:23:34] So you again I don't mean to overstate
- [01:23:36] this and I certainly don't mean to claim
- [01:23:39] that there's some answer that's right
- [01:23:41] for everybody of course but surely this
- [01:23:43] is the right kind of question and surely
- [01:23:45] for many people who are listening to
- [01:23:46] this the answer is yeah I mean in some
- [01:23:49] sense some very rough sense that's
- [01:23:51] probably right for me and so if I'm in a
- [01:23:54] stagnant situation and really every
- [01:23:57] other option has been exhausted and
- [01:23:58] isn't going to happen this is simply a
- [01:24:00] stagnant thing maybe there's something
- [01:24:02] else needs to happen I I need to leave.
- [01:24:05] The company needs to change some drastic
- [01:24:06] way. I sell the company. I change jobs.
- [01:24:10] I I don't know. Like, of course, it's
- [01:24:12] going to be super context specific and
- [01:24:13] and and personal, right? But like
- [01:24:15] something dramatic may need to change
- [01:24:17] because nothing incrementally is
- [01:24:19] changing.
- [01:24:20] So this final question, do you need to
- [01:24:23] grow or if you're not growing, you're
- [01:24:24] dying? Is that true? And are you
- [01:24:26] therefore dying? And what needs to
- [01:24:27] happen? You know, so if you were looking
- [01:24:29] for more metrics in another framework,
- [01:24:31] sorry, that's ex is ex existential, but
- [01:24:34] it is it is existential. So, uh,
- [01:24:39] uh, do you have to only ask this at the
- [01:24:42] end of the chain? No. Of course, you
- [01:24:44] should feel fulfilled. And, you know, of
- [01:24:45] course, you want to be checking in with
- [01:24:47] yourself at least annually, of course.
- [01:24:49] But, um, I sort of put at the end of my
- [01:24:51] list in the sense that I'm assuming the
- [01:24:54] original question is about the company,
- [01:24:56] you know. Um uh but but especially with
- [01:24:59] smaller companies, but but also also
- [01:25:01] with big public companies. There's
- [01:25:02] plenty of big public companies that
- [01:25:03] aren't growing, aren't there?
- [01:25:06] So like this is this is uh this is true
- [01:25:08] of all scales because there are natural
- [01:25:11] sizes for things. Um so yeah, it's a
- [01:25:15] little philosophical, but uh I think
- [01:25:17] it's quite important.
- [01:25:18] >> Such a beautiful way to wrap up this
- [01:25:20] piece. Uh, a lot of people listening to
- [01:25:22] the podcast are bootstrap founders and
- [01:25:25] for them this is actually very much an
- [01:25:27] option. They can just be happy with the
- [01:25:28] revenue they're generating. Like with my
- [01:25:30] newsletter right now, I'd be very sad if
- [01:25:32] it stopped growing,
- [01:25:33] >> but also just it's uh amazing the life
- [01:25:36] it has created for me. And even if it
- [01:25:38] did stop growing and just stay flat and
- [01:25:41] doesn't become an elephant curve, that'd
- [01:25:43] be incredible in like in practice
- [01:25:45] psychologically still hard for that to
- [01:25:48] be the case. And that's why this
- [01:25:50] component of the of the sequence is
- [01:25:52] really important. Like why do you
- [01:25:53] actually need it to grow? Is that just
- [01:25:55] your ego? Is that just like I'm used to
- [01:25:57] growth? It can also help you help you
- [01:25:59] avoid
- [01:26:01] doing unnatural things that you actually
- [01:26:03] regret to grow. So like if growth at all
- [01:26:05] costs is just the the thing like there's
- [01:26:07] probably ways you could quote unquote
- [01:26:09] grow the newsletter that you would just
- [01:26:10] say I just wouldn't be proud of that and
- [01:26:13] the newsletter is doing so well I don't
- [01:26:15] need to do that. And so again, maybe
- [01:26:17] that's a softer version because growth
- [01:26:19] hasn't actually stopped. But okay, it's
- [01:26:20] a softer version of um I certainly don't
- [01:26:23] agree with grow. You you might say, I
- [01:26:24] certainly don't agree with growth at all
- [01:26:26] costs. I want to grow as much as
- [01:26:28] possible within the things that I'm
- [01:26:29] proud of. Like if we grew fast, but the
- [01:26:31] content was crappy. I'm just not willing
- [01:26:34] to do that. It's like not the point, you
- [01:26:36] know? And so it helps set up these
- [01:26:37] boundaries of like, wait a minute, not
- [01:26:39] if dot dot dot. And uh you know, early
- [01:26:41] on we may not have that um that
- [01:26:43] flexibility. You could argue that you
- [01:26:44] should have those values early on
- [01:26:46] because that's who you are and that's
- [01:26:47] what you're doing and people respond. So
- [01:26:48] I could argue you should have that all
- [01:26:50] along. But I could also argue that at
- [01:26:52] the beginning you're just trying to do
- [01:26:53] something where you don't die. You're
- [01:26:55] starting to blog. You're probably
- [01:26:56] copying other people's style. You
- [01:26:58] probably don't have that much uh unique
- [01:26:59] things to say. So there's a lot of reg.
- [01:27:01] That's okay. You're just trying to get
- [01:27:02] going. It's okay. Now 20 years later if
- [01:27:05] you have no style and no voice of your
- [01:27:06] own and nothing new to say that's
- [01:27:07] probably not good. But to get going,
- [01:27:09] sure. So um sometimes we have this thing
- [01:27:12] where we get going with maybe looser I
- [01:27:15] don't want to say values I'm not saying
- [01:27:16] it's unethical but like looser sort of
- [01:27:18] bar or a pride that we have in our own
- [01:27:20] work and we tighten it up as we're sort
- [01:27:22] of able um as we can afford to you might
- [01:27:25] even say so good but that's a then that
- [01:27:28] becomes a nice filter here of like what
- [01:27:31] what is it in a greater sense I'm trying
- [01:27:33] to do here I'm willing to do here. Um,
- [01:27:36] so if you're not growing your dying,
- [01:27:37] fair, but like that has to come with
- [01:27:38] these limits and and the the more
- [01:27:39] successful you are, the more you can be
- [01:27:41] serious about those limits.
- [01:27:43] >> I think an important element of this is
- [01:27:44] also the product you're currently
- [01:27:46] working on. Maybe it's okay for it just
- [01:27:48] to not grow. There's a good opportunity
- [01:27:50] to do something else, have this thing
- [01:27:51] maybe running on the side, maybe sunset
- [01:27:53] it at some point, but it's a good
- [01:27:55] opportunity to be like, okay, wait, what
- [01:27:56] else is out there? We had a a recent
- [01:27:58] podcast conversation with Matt McKinn
- [01:28:00] McInness uh CPO at Ripling and there's
- [01:28:03] some really good advice he shared on
- [01:28:04] just when to quit when to quit your
- [01:28:07] startup. Just like you know if it's like
- [01:28:08] four or five years in it's just not
- [01:28:09] clicking maybe it's time to to move on
- [01:28:12] and even though people do succeed years
- [01:28:14] in uh most likely it's not going to be
- [01:28:16] you. I have a book almost out now that's
- [01:28:18] on pre-order about topics like what
- [01:28:20] we've been talking. The next book I want
- [01:28:22] to write is on this topic of
- [01:28:26] how do I make these decisions of
- [01:28:27] uncertainty like maybe it is time to
- [01:28:29] quit, maybe I should move to a different
- [01:28:31] city, maybe I should marry this person,
- [01:28:33] maybe I should launch this company,
- [01:28:34] maybe it's time to maybe I should use
- [01:28:35] this strategy where you want to you you
- [01:28:38] want to use probability and expected
- [01:28:40] value. It's unlikely that dot dot dot,
- [01:28:43] right? But the truth is we don't know
- [01:28:44] what the probability is. We don't know
- [01:28:45] what the probability curves look like.
- [01:28:48] We actually can't use expected value.
- [01:28:49] And anyway, even if you could have
- [01:28:51] expected value, I am a human being. This
- [01:28:53] is my life and I either sell the company
- [01:28:55] or I don't. And so all this stuff about
- [01:28:58] probability and like that's not that
- [01:29:00] doesn't apply to me. I need other ways
- [01:29:01] of of sorting this out. So I guess I
- [01:29:04] would just say briefly um probability is
- [01:29:08] not going to work for these decisions.
- [01:29:12] So that doesn't say what is right. Um,
- [01:29:14] but it's not that. And so, uh, which is
- [01:29:18] nice because you can put those tools
- [01:29:19] down. I'll do some market research to
- [01:29:21] see if I'll I should sell my company.
- [01:29:23] Nope. That's not where the answers are.
- [01:29:26] >> More uh more questions than answers on
- [01:29:27] that one.
- [01:29:28] >> Yeah.
- [01:29:28] >> Um, speaking of the book, um, let's give
- [01:29:31] you a chance to share what is what
- [01:29:33] you're working on and when this is
- [01:29:34] coming out and when where folks can find
- [01:29:36] it.
- [01:29:36] >> Sure. So, the book is called Hidden
- [01:29:38] Multipliers, and you can pre-order it at
- [01:29:41] hidden multipliers.com, or I guess if
- [01:29:43] this is out long enough, I'll
- [01:29:45] you order it, I guess, depending on when
- [01:29:48] you're listening to this. And it's it's
- [01:29:50] a lot of stuff kind of like we were
- [01:29:51] talking about today. Um, these questions
- [01:29:53] of uh it's called multipliers because
- [01:29:56] the idea is little things that you can
- [01:29:58] do or little decisions you can make that
- [01:30:00] have a huge impact. And like moving the
- [01:30:03] cancellation rate from 5 to 4%. sounds
- [01:30:06] small has a huge thing onboarding as
- [01:30:07] opposed to later used huge thing. So
- [01:30:09] those are some examples but the book is
- [01:30:10] is of course full of different kinds of
- [01:30:12] topics but all of this idea of this
- [01:30:15] stuff that has such a big impact on
- [01:30:17] things like revenue and profit. Um, and
- [01:30:20] either just as you said earlier, either
- [01:30:22] like either maybe you have never thought
- [01:30:24] of it that way, so you didn't really you
- [01:30:25] weren't thinking about it right or yeah,
- [01:30:28] you you've heard that you say I know,
- [01:30:30] but your actions don't reflect it. And
- [01:30:31] so if we go deep enough with examples
- [01:30:33] and specific things to do, then you can
- [01:30:35] actually act on on that supposed
- [01:30:37] knowledge and and and realize those
- [01:30:39] multipliers.
- [01:30:40] >> And uh just to remind people, you're all
- [01:30:42] hidden multipliers.com.
- [01:30:44] >> Yeah.
- [01:30:45] >> And there's an S at the end. H h h h h h
- [01:30:46] h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h m m m m m
- [01:30:47] m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
- [01:30:47] multipliers,
- [01:30:48] >> right? There's more than one.
- [01:30:49] >> Many. There's more than one.
- [01:30:51] >> Yeah. Yeah.
- [01:30:52] >> Jason, I had other things I wanted to
- [01:30:54] talk about, but I feel like this
- [01:30:56] episode's actually going to be stronger
- [01:30:57] if we just focus on the thing that we've
- [01:30:59] been talking about, which is unstalling
- [01:31:01] growth.
- [01:31:03] So, if we do that, is there anything
- [01:31:05] else you want to mention or leave
- [01:31:08] listeners with before we get to a couple
- [01:31:10] corners and then the lightning round? I
- [01:31:13] think if you if you tried to find a
- [01:31:14] common thread throughout all this stuff
- [01:31:17] about growth, it comes back to the
- [01:31:19] customer getting value.
- [01:31:22] And I know we just we already talked
- [01:31:23] about that, but I think if if there
- [01:31:25] could be one thing where it would help
- [01:31:29] solve kind of all of it, it would be
- [01:31:31] that they really are getting value. your
- [01:31:33] product actually promises the right
- [01:31:35] thing and then it actually delivers on
- [01:31:37] that thing and the customers can onboard
- [01:31:39] so that they can do the thing and the
- [01:31:41] customers know they realize that they're
- [01:31:43] getting the thing and you're measuring
- [01:31:45] the thing so you know it's increasing um
- [01:31:48] that is probably if I was an LLM I'd
- [01:31:49] probably say that's the common thread or
- [01:31:51] if you know there's many ways that
- [01:31:53] manifests of course but but but but if
- [01:31:56] that's your northstar is how are we
- [01:31:59] actually creating value in the way the
- [01:32:00] customer values it and their language
- [01:32:03] and their way and their way of
- [01:32:04] understanding it. I wouldn't say all the
- [01:32:07] pieces magically fit into place, but
- [01:32:09] certainly isn't that sort of the root
- [01:32:11] thing that that is going to make all the
- [01:32:13] stuff work then there will be a good way
- [01:32:15] to do pricing and they will stay as long
- [01:32:17] as possible and you know like these
- [01:32:18] things will probably be right if if that
- [01:32:20] so this idea of creating value for the
- [01:32:22] customer and split and then figuring how
- [01:32:23] to split with them is probably the root
- [01:32:25] idea and of course I hesitate because
- [01:32:28] platitudes like that are actually not
- [01:32:29] actionable not very actionable like all
- [01:32:31] right well I'll move on with my day and
- [01:32:32] that's why Twitter's not so useful but
- [01:32:35] given that we've gone into so much
- [01:32:36] detail. Perhaps that's a nice way of
- [01:32:38] summarizing it.
- [01:32:39] >> I think that's such an important point.
- [01:32:41] I think what's also interesting is some
- [01:32:42] of your advice is the value may you may
- [01:32:45] be picking the wrong customer, the wrong
- [01:32:47] market. You may be positioning it wrong.
- [01:32:49] So the value may be there. You're just
- [01:32:51] trying to convince the wrong people
- [01:32:53] about it.
- [01:32:54] >> Yeah, there's so many ways to get it
- [01:32:55] wrong. Uh, right? Because because all
- [01:32:58] like we said, all these things have to
- [01:32:59] be right. You just said another one
- [01:33:01] which is and you have to say it in a way
- [01:33:02] that when this person hits the homepage,
- [01:33:04] they know it.
- [01:33:06] It's true. But do they know that?
- [01:33:08] >> Just so many things have to go right.
- [01:33:10] >> What a what a tough job we've got over
- [01:33:12] here just solving people's problems.
- [01:33:14] Come on.
- [01:33:15] >> Well, thanks for growing.
- [01:33:18] >> So now we will be after this
- [01:33:20] conversation.
- [01:33:22] >> Okay. So I'm going to take us to uh a
- [01:33:24] recurring corner, a recurring segment on
- [01:33:26] the podcast that I call AI corner.
- [01:33:29] What's one way that you have discovered
- [01:33:32] uh using AI in your work or in your life
- [01:33:35] that might be helpful for folks to hear?
- [01:33:37] >> There's a lot of data on the internet
- [01:33:39] and it's often in things like images
- [01:33:41] which makes it hard to do your own
- [01:33:42] analysis or plug it in or etc. Come up
- [01:33:45] with your own models or apply it. But I
- [01:33:47] found that AI is really good actually
- [01:33:48] especially Gemini at say you just give
- [01:33:51] it to it and give a chart to it and say
- [01:33:53] like make this into a table that I can
- [01:33:54] paste like literally say that I can
- [01:33:56] paste into Google Sheets and it will do
- [01:33:57] it in a way that literally you can copy
- [01:33:59] and it will actually paste correctly
- [01:34:00] into Google Sheets and then you can do
- [01:34:02] stuff. So especially with the book and
- [01:34:04] and and my articles uh I I I love to use
- [01:34:07] real data and as whenever I can of
- [01:34:09] course and um um so I I do that all the
- [01:34:11] time. So, um I think that kind of
- [01:34:14] interpretation is uh is very useful. And
- [01:34:18] so all of a sudden you can get 10
- [01:34:19] examples of something and test a theory
- [01:34:21] where before it was kind of just too
- [01:34:22] hard and you didn't.
- [01:34:23] >> That's an awesome tip because people
- [01:34:25] know you can generate all these
- [01:34:26] infographics with um especially with
- [01:34:29] with Gemini and Nano Banana and all
- [01:34:31] these things. Uh that's really cool to
- [01:34:32] know. You can just feed it. Here's a
- [01:34:33] here's a chart. Make it make it text.
- [01:34:35] >> Yeah.
- [01:34:36] >> Okay. I'm going to now take us to
- [01:34:37] contrarian corner. The question here is
- [01:34:40] what's something that you believe that
- [01:34:41] most other people don't?
- [01:34:43] >> AB testing doesn't work very well and it
- [01:34:45] doesn't work on most things.
- [01:34:47] It won't work on strategy or vision or
- [01:34:50] insights like nothing actually important
- [01:34:53] to the success of the company. You don't
- [01:34:55] AB test whether Uber is a good idea.
- [01:34:58] Um and then even when you do AB test the
- [01:35:01] details where I agree like sometimes
- [01:35:03] that can work. What happens is people
- [01:35:05] will try things like oh I'll just you
- [01:35:06] know try this verb and that verb and
- [01:35:08] this ad and that ad and then like oh the
- [01:35:10] seventh or eighth one I got a positive
- [01:35:12] result that must be good and what
- [01:35:14] happens is um you keep doing that you
- [01:35:17] pick the good best one and then you you
- [01:35:19] go on and you find another one and pick
- [01:35:21] the best one and then a year later you
- [01:35:22] look back and you should be like 50 or
- [01:35:24] 100% better because you've stacked these
- [01:35:26] things and you look back and like
- [01:35:27] nothing's different. The conversion
- [01:35:29] rates are the same as they've always
- [01:35:30] been. You see what the hell happened?
- [01:35:32] and I thought I picked the the winner.
- [01:35:33] And and the answer is in a combination
- [01:35:36] of the tools not being statistically
- [01:35:38] accurate, which they're not. And the
- [01:35:41] fact that you will get false positives
- [01:35:43] even if the tool is statistically
- [01:35:44] accurate, means that most of them are
- [01:35:46] false positives. Even if the tool is 95%
- [01:35:49] accurate when the thing you're looking
- [01:35:50] for is rare, which it is in the case of
- [01:35:52] AB testing, uh it the false positives
- [01:35:55] are happen more often than the actual
- [01:35:57] thing happens. And so most of the
- [01:35:59] results you get are false positives
- [01:36:01] anyway. So, as a result, this isn't true
- [01:36:03] of all AB testing, but for mo what most
- [01:36:06] people do when they just do the sort of
- [01:36:07] the the mundane AB testing, you can't AB
- [01:36:10] test the important things and the
- [01:36:12] details are mostly false positives. So,
- [01:36:13] it's an enormous waste of time unless
- [01:36:16] you're incredibly sophisticated. I know
- [01:36:17] there's special groups that actually are
- [01:36:19] very sophisticated. Fine. If you're not
- [01:36:20] doing that, it's sort of like the poker
- [01:36:22] table. If you don't know who the psy is,
- [01:36:24] it's you, right? If you don't have all
- [01:36:26] of this information and and knowledge
- [01:36:28] about AB testing, then you're the psy.
- [01:36:31] >> Bam. All right. Uh I will just say that
- [01:36:34] I have found AB testing useful in my
- [01:36:36] career. I think it's maybe at a certain
- [01:36:38] scale when you're just kind of trying to
- [01:36:40] optimize and continue to grow, you know,
- [01:36:43] where it's like millions of users like a
- [01:36:45] percentage gain is like millions of
- [01:36:46] dollars.
- [01:36:47] >> True.
- [01:36:47] >> Most people are not working at that
- [01:36:48] scale. Most people, right?
- [01:36:50] >> Yeah. So, just wanted to uh for folks
- [01:36:53] that find it valuable. That's true.
- [01:36:55] >> Uh but I love it.
- [01:36:56] >> However, even so on your on your own
- [01:36:57] podcast when you were interviewing the
- [01:36:59] guy from Shopify um and he was saying
- [01:37:01] how uh maybe a third of the things that
- [01:37:04] they found with their systems just
- [01:37:06] disappear. They just magically
- [01:37:08] disappear.
- [01:37:09] >> And they're they have a team of 100
- [01:37:10] people and they're really good at it
- [01:37:12] >> and like their effects disappear all the
- [01:37:13] time that so they double check later
- [01:37:15] whether the whether the immediate effect
- [01:37:16] goes away because even then,
- [01:37:19] >> right? I think that was the CTO of
- [01:37:20] Shopify conversation.
- [01:37:22] >> Okay. Yeah.
- [01:37:22] >> Yeah. Sweet. Okay. Worth of memory cuz I
- [01:37:24] listen to a lot of episodes but I don't
- [01:37:26] >> such a good one. I love that. Yeah.
- [01:37:28] Where they leave they leave like a hold
- [01:37:29] out group essentially and then they just
- [01:37:31] look back was the effect something that
- [01:37:32] lasted and most times it didn't.
- [01:37:34] >> Yeah.
- [01:37:35] >> There you go. And that's with a lot of
- [01:37:36] So that's what I mean. If you're doing
- [01:37:38] that level of stuff,
- [01:37:40] >> good for you. But if you're not, I don't
- [01:37:41] know, man.
- [01:37:42] >> There we go. Well, Jason, uh I'm It's
- [01:37:46] always a really good sign when I'm just
- [01:37:47] like I can't wait to get this
- [01:37:48] conversation out the door and into
- [01:37:50] people's minds because this there's so
- [01:37:52] much value here. Uh I'm just uh already
- [01:37:54] anticipating all the people are going to
- [01:37:56] reply and just like I had so many ideas
- [01:37:57] for what to do with my product. Um which
- [01:38:00] is exactly the goal. And with that we
- [01:38:02] have reached our very exciting lightning
- [01:38:04] round. I've got five questions for you.
- [01:38:05] Are you ready?
- [01:38:06] >> Boy. Yeah. I mean I don't like talking a
- [01:38:08] long time anyway. So lightning is great.
- [01:38:10] >> Here we go. What are two or three books
- [01:38:14] that you find yourself recommending most
- [01:38:15] to other people
- [01:38:16] >> for writing on writing well by William
- [01:38:19] Zinszer. I know I'm not the only one but
- [01:38:21] that's kind of the point. um on my best
- [01:38:23] day I write like that. Um and then for
- [01:38:26] for uh for product I actually like
- [01:38:28] crossing the chasm which of course
- [01:38:31] everyone's heard of but what I find is
- [01:38:33] no one's read it so that you know the
- [01:38:35] little picture and you think you know
- [01:38:36] what the chasm is. What I find is very
- [01:38:38] quickly I I realized oh you haven't read
- [01:38:40] the book you saw a blog post and you and
- [01:38:41] there's so much good stuff in there how
- [01:38:44] to define a market and really what to do
- [01:38:47] with this model. It's fantastic. So I
- [01:38:49] highly recommend reading the book. I've
- [01:38:51] had a Jeffrey Moore on the podcast. We
- [01:38:53] dove into a lot of this stuff. One of
- [01:38:54] the things that always stuck with me is
- [01:38:56] um when early companies are looking for
- [01:38:59] someone like them to adopt the thing.
- [01:39:01] That's something that really stuck with
- [01:39:02] me. It's not like they're looking for an
- [01:39:03] early adopter to be like, "Oh, this is
- [01:39:05] awesome." Like they're looking for
- [01:39:07] someone that feels like them to say,
- [01:39:09] "This is great." And so the early
- [01:39:10] adopters are just going to spread to
- [01:39:11] other early adopters and there's there's
- [01:39:13] work to do.
- [01:39:14] >> Yeah. Part of that's because he defines
- [01:39:16] a market in among other things as and
- [01:39:18] the people in the market respect the
- [01:39:21] opinions of the other people in the
- [01:39:22] market.
- [01:39:23] >> Exactly.
- [01:39:23] >> And that's when you realize, oh, so
- [01:39:25] jumping to a different market, it's not
- [01:39:26] impossible. It's just you like like case
- [01:39:28] studies aren't going to work.
- [01:39:29] >> Yeah. And then you think, okay, and then
- [01:39:32] on writing well such a huge run of the
- [01:39:34] book. That's like the book that most
- [01:39:35] helped me write. And if you summarize
- [01:39:37] the book for me, it's just cut. Cut more
- [01:39:40] and more of your stuff. There's always
- [01:39:42] to cut. I love this phrase where he's
- [01:39:45] he's um he's on a panel with with this
- [01:39:47] guy who is like an amateur writer and
- [01:39:50] his his kind of summary is to that guy
- [01:39:52] is I I uh he the guy told him I never
- [01:39:56] knew writing could be hard and Zenzer
- [01:39:59] says I never knew writing could be easy.
- [01:40:02] I think both of those kind of summarize
- [01:40:04] the the the turmoil of being a writer.
- [01:40:07] >> Yeah. The classic maybe Hemingway maybe
- [01:40:10] not quote uh writing is easy. I just sit
- [01:40:13] at the typewriter and bleed
- [01:40:14] >> and bleed. Yeah.
- [01:40:15] >> So good. Okay, moving on. Favorite
- [01:40:17] recent movie or TV show?
- [01:40:19] >> Er
- [01:40:21] from 1994.
- [01:40:23] 15 seasons. Why do I Why do I say that?
- [01:40:26] Besides the fact I think it's good. I
- [01:40:28] have a 16-year-old daughter
- [01:40:30] >> and we have we're now on season I think
- [01:40:32] 13 watching this whole thing. She says
- [01:40:35] it holds up after 25 years and being you
- [01:40:38] know gen alpha or whatever. I don't even
- [01:40:39] know what it is. And so if if this is an
- [01:40:42] era an era when, you know, shows were an
- [01:40:45] hour long and seasons were forever and
- [01:40:48] uh and she says it's great TV, it must
- [01:40:50] be great TV.
- [01:40:52] >> Wow. I've not had that on this podcast
- [01:40:54] yet. Um also The Pit. I don't know if
- [01:40:56] you enjoy ER, you'll enjoy The Pit,
- [01:40:58] which just won all these awards.
- [01:40:59] >> Yep. If it's good
- [01:40:59] >> on Netflix. Um, fun fact, my cousin was
- [01:41:02] in ER, not as a recurring character, but
- [01:41:05] she was like a young girl patient and
- [01:41:07] now she's a fancy actress in the world.
- [01:41:10] >> Oh, cool.
- [01:41:10] >> That was her start.
- [01:41:12] >> Okay, next question. Favorite product
- [01:41:14] you've recently discovered that you
- [01:41:15] really love.
- [01:41:16] >> Um, this is probably not unique, but
- [01:41:18] Whisper Flow for dictation. It's really
- [01:41:21] good. I like the keyboard shortcuts
- [01:41:22] because it, you know, I just use it all
- [01:41:24] the time in all the software and
- [01:41:26] anything anchor makes. you know, they
- [01:41:28] have like power stations and docks and
- [01:41:31] recharging
- [01:41:31] >> over the K.
- [01:41:32] >> Uh yeah, ANK, right? Um and uh just all
- [01:41:36] their stuff is super high quality and
- [01:41:38] works really well. Everything seems to
- [01:41:39] charge twice as fast when plugged into
- [01:41:41] an Anchor thing. So, I don't know,
- [01:41:42] whatever it is, it's really good.
- [01:41:44] >> I got a new Inker charger. I also love
- [01:41:46] Anker. Uh that has like a display on the
- [01:41:48] side when you plug in stuff and it's got
- [01:41:49] like multiple ports and it shows you
- [01:41:50] like the percentage it's charging and
- [01:41:52] the wattage per outlet. I love it.
- [01:41:54] They're just like, "How do we make this
- [01:41:56] more fancy and fun and charge more?"
- [01:41:58] >> Yeah,
- [01:41:58] >> I love it. Yeah. And then Whisper Flow,
- [01:42:01] quick shout out. They are uh you get a
- [01:42:03] year free of Whisperflow by becoming a
- [01:42:06] uh insider. I think even just an annual
- [01:42:07] subscriber of my newsletter uh as part
- [01:42:10] of the product pass. And so uh check it
- [01:42:12] out. Lenny's product pass.com. You can
- [01:42:14] also check out
- [01:42:15] >> I did not know that. I'm not a shill for
- [01:42:17] them.
- [01:42:17] >> No, I love that. I love when people
- [01:42:18] recommend products in the product pass.
- [01:42:20] A whole
- [01:42:20] >> because I'm a subscriber for long enough
- [01:42:21] that I didn't get that.
- [01:42:23] >> You missed out. You missed out. There's
- [01:42:24] 19 products in there right now. By the
- [01:42:26] time this comes out, there will be even
- [01:42:27] more.
- [01:42:28] >> Okay, two more questions. Do you have a
- [01:42:30] favorite life motto that you find
- [01:42:32] yourself coming back to in work or in
- [01:42:34] life?
- [01:42:35] >> Yes. Be yourself. Everyone else is
- [01:42:37] taken.
- [01:42:39] And it's attributed to Oscar Wild, but
- [01:42:41] I've tried to look into that as I tried
- [01:42:44] to get all my annotations correct for
- [01:42:45] the book. And there's no evidence that
- [01:42:47] he said it. But there's also no evidence
- [01:42:50] who said it. So, let's say it's Oscar
- [01:42:51] Wild because he said lots of things like
- [01:42:52] that. I love that and it's such a deep
- [01:42:55] point like you know it's easy to hear
- [01:42:56] and be like yeah yeah yeah but it's it's
- [01:42:58] something I've learned to be more and
- [01:43:00] more true every time especially as you
- [01:43:01] see people online doing their thing and
- [01:43:03] just like oh I want to be like that and
- [01:43:04] then you realize no you got to be
- [01:43:05] yourself.
- [01:43:06] >> No and and the people who love you or
- [01:43:09] like what you do also want you to be
- [01:43:11] yourself because that's what they love
- [01:43:12] and if you're changed then they wouldn't
- [01:43:13] love that. So
- [01:43:14] >> final question you have this fancy award
- [01:43:16] behind you on your desk. I'm curious
- [01:43:19] what's the story there? That's the
- [01:43:21] Ernstston Young Entrepreneur of the Year
- [01:43:23] award for 2017 for Central Texas, which
- [01:43:26] I co-un with the CEO of WP Engine,
- [01:43:29] Heather Bruner. Uh, which is awesome
- [01:43:31] because I I often call Heather our a
- [01:43:34] late joining co-founder because that's
- [01:43:36] what um LinkedIn that's what Reed
- [01:43:38] Hoffman called Jeff Weiner because you
- [01:43:40] know Jeff was like you know four years
- [01:43:41] in but was so impactful
- [01:43:45] to everything the success of the company
- [01:43:47] the culture d that like basically is a
- [01:43:49] co-founder and that's exactly what
- [01:43:51] Heather is like at WP Engine. It's now
- [01:43:53] been 11 years since she she became the
- [01:43:56] CEO. So, this is a, you know, there's
- [01:43:59] lots of um data to back this up. And I
- [01:44:02] and I I used to say to people at the at
- [01:44:05] WP Engine like if I just told you that
- [01:44:07] Heather was a co-founder, you'd say,
- [01:44:08] "Yeah, no, no kidding." I'm like,
- [01:44:10] "Right, that's what that's why I think
- [01:44:12] of it that way because so do you. So did
- [01:44:13] anyone because that that's the impact
- [01:44:14] she's had." So, we co-win that award,
- [01:44:16] which is nice because you almost never
- [01:44:18] have co-winners. In fact, like I I can't
- [01:44:21] remember another one. I mean, I know
- [01:44:22] there are others, but there it's rare
- [01:44:23] enough I can't think of another one. So,
- [01:44:25] it's really cool that we co-wrun that uh
- [01:44:28] entrepreneur award.
- [01:44:29] >> Jason, this was so awesome. I really
- [01:44:31] appreciate you making time. I really
- [01:44:32] appreciate you sharing so much wisdom
- [01:44:34] with us. Uh two final questions. Where
- [01:44:36] can folks find you online? Point them to
- [01:44:37] your book, your website, and how can
- [01:44:40] listeners be useful to you?
- [01:44:41] >> Yeah, I mean to be useful, order the
- [01:44:43] book, hidden multipliers.com, or of
- [01:44:47] course, you don't have to. You can uh I
- [01:44:48] have all these articles online for free.
- [01:44:50] So, you can go to asmartbear.com
- [01:44:53] and I'm on Twitter and other stuff
- [01:44:54] that's all linked off of that website
- [01:44:56] and the articles uh they're they're
- [01:44:59] free. I don't have ads. I don't sell
- [01:45:01] courses. I don't I don't sell anything.
- [01:45:03] So, like that's that's very very
- [01:45:05] non-commercial. Um and so the in fact
- [01:45:07] the one thing I've ever done with
- [01:45:08] writing that costs money is the book
- [01:45:10] because you know it's a physical book.
- [01:45:11] I've got to charge something so I can
- [01:45:13] ship it and everything. So, uh um but I
- [01:45:17] think Hidden Multipliers is is certainly
- [01:45:19] my best work. So, um so I'm very I'm
- [01:45:22] very proud of that. But, uh but you
- [01:45:24] don't have to buy it. It's okay.
- [01:45:25] >> This is our chance to this is our chance
- [01:45:27] to repay you for all the free content
- [01:45:28] you've put out over time, right?
- [01:45:30] >> And so, I'm going to order a number of
- [01:45:32] them.
- [01:45:33] >> Jason, thank you so much for being here.
- [01:45:34] >> Thank you. This is fun.
- [01:45:36] >> So fun. Bye, everyone.
