AI 인터뷰어00:57

Yes, we're focusing on your makeup routine today. Could you show us the very first step you take and the product you use for your makeup regimen?

참여자01:54

Yes. I would say the first product I usually start with, sometimes I switch is the or, actually, I'll say this. The say sun visor radiant moisturizer. So here, this is. And this is what I start with because not only does it moisturize, it has SPF in it. And then it's also tinted, so it gives my face kind of a base color and something that's really easy to build upon. It's a little bit of coverage, so I don't usually, like, high coverage foundation. So this is why I really like this one, and I start off with this product.

참여자02:39

Okay. So the next product I will use is this Too Faced Hangover Primer here, and this is so the makeup goes on smoothly. I find my makeup a applies a lot nicer if I have this product versus if I don't use it, and then it also helps the makeup stay on longer.

참여자04:06

So I don't use this product every day. I would say sometimes I use it and sometimes I don't. Depending on if my skin looks dull or for the purpose that I'm applying makeup. So if it's just everyday makeup, I probably won't use this step. But if I'm going out or I just feel like my skin needs it, this is just, like, the, say, glowy super gel illuminator. And here is that up close to the camera. And, again, it just kind of provides, like, a sheer base and glowy dewy look. It's sometimes a lot with this first product I use, so that's also why I don't always use it But I would say this is a product that I use sometimes in my routine.

참여자05:12

Okay. So the next product I have is the Glossier Stretch Concealer. And here's that product up in front of the camera. But I will apply this under my eyes. And if I have any pimples or acne or just any texture that I wanna cover up, I will use this product. And, it'll brighten my under eyes as well. So here, this is, again, in front of the camera.

AI 인터뷰어05:14

참여자05:54

Okay. So the next step in my routine is this Charlotte Tilbury pressed powder. I will apply this over the spots that I put the concealer to just kind of set that in place. And I also feel like it blends the concealer and prevents the concealer from creasing at all. So here, this is, again, in front of the camera, the Charlotte Tilbury press powder.

So the next step in my routine is gonna be a blush. I rotate between a lot of blushes. Uh, I will say this depends on the season. It depends on how my skin is looking. It depends on my outfit or just how I'm feeling that day. So I will show just a couple of brought blush products, but I will apply on my cheek and kind of upwards, sometimes a little bit on nose. This is the road pocket blush in shade teddy. I believe. So here's an example of a shade that I use, but I have all sorts of blushes. I would say it's probably my favorite makeup product. So I have the Charlotte Tilbury, wand blush. I have the glossier cloud paint. And, again, I don't use these all at the same time. But I love to rotate. Um, another one of my favorites, I think I have down here, is the Rare Beauty blush in pinch. So these are just a few examples here I'm showing the camera as well. It's my favorite product, so that's why I have a lot of them. Again, I won't use these all at the same time, and I tend to rotate based on various factors. It's really fun to have a lot of blushes. So, um, yeah, again, here is probably the one I use the most. Again, the road pocket blush.

AI 인터뷰어07:32

Which blush product are you planning to use today? Please show us the product in front of the camera. If you have multiple options, feel free to share a couple that you're considering.

참여자08:17

I would say today, I will probably do the road pocket blush. I'm not going out anywhere. So if I'm going out somewhere, I just tend to wanna do a more dramatic blush. And one of the reasons I like this blush is that it's a pretty subtle shade. Uh, if I was going out I would consider maybe a more dramatic blush like the Cloud Paint and Shade Huff. That's a really dramatic one. It has a lot of pigment. So, yeah, today, the road pocket blush will be my go to.

AI 인터뷰어08:19

참여자09:39

So these two are kind of combined and I don't always use them together, but this is another one. It depends on what I'm going for or how I'm feeling. This next step is contour. So I will either use the Charlotte Tilbury contour wand That's if maybe I'm feeling extra puffy. Maybe I want a little bit more of a contoured look. Or if I want something subtler, I'll go with the Hula Benefit bronzer. And this is a powder, and this is a cream. So it they just kind of blend and go on differently. So yeah, it just kinda depends on how I'm feeling that day today. I will probably again, something subtler, just go with the Hoola bronzer. And I do that after my blush, and I'll just blend that in with a brush or a beauty blender. And, yeah, that's the next step of my routine, and I'll show it to the camera one more time, the Hoola benefit bronzer.

AI 인터뷰어09:41

That's a versatile approach to contouring based on your mood and look for the day. Please go ahead and show us the Hoola Benefit bronzer in front of the camera for the next step in your routine.

참여자10:02

Here, that is for, like, again, in front of the camera.

AI 인터뷰어10:04

Could you please show us the contour product you mentioned, whether it's the cream or powder you use based on your mood and look for the day?

참여자10:26

Here is the Charlotte Tilbury contour I don't know why I'm twisting it that way. The Charlotte Tilbury contour wand up close on the camera.

AI 인터뷰어10:28

You showed us the Charlotte Tilbury contour wand up close on the camera. Now, for the last question, if you have any more steps remaining, please explain them all at once.

참여자13:05

Okay. I will go ahead and explain the rest of my routine. So after I apply the blush and the contour, I will do my eyebrow gel, and I just use the Rare Beauty eyebrow gel. And it's a clear shade, so I really don't have to do much I just brush my eyebrows with it. That's to get my eyebrows to just stay in place. And, yeah, that's pretty easy step. Then I will also go in with highlighter. I will use the benefit cookie highlighter. This is a powdered highlighter. I really like this one. And if I want it to be a little bit more intense I will also layer the benefit highlighter with this is another benefit highlighter in high beam, and this is, like, the liquid version. And so I will layer those two. If I'm going out, if I wanted to be more dramatic, but every day will typically just be the benefit cookie. And then, usually, the last few steps in my routine are mascara, and eyeliner. So I will go in with the Ilia mascara here. Well, first, I go in with an eyelash curler, but here's the Ilia mascara I use. And then I will use this book some eyeliner here just right under my eye. I think it makes my eyes a little bit more dramatic. I've been doing this for years. Those are essential. Part of my everyday look is mascara. And then, finally, I will also do some sort of lip product. And so I will usually go in my favorite one right now is the Too Faced lip injection. And so this I have really thin lips, so this makes my lips look a little bit bigger, and I really like that, um, that it does that. And then it has a nice gloss and shine along with the plumping effect. So that is one more step after that. Finally, the last step is the two faced hangover. Let me just get a better look of that. Too Faced Hangover Setting Spray. This is actually the three in one replenishing and setting spray. So I use this at the very end of my routine just to set everything together, and it also gives my skin, like, a dewy glow after everything is done and helps my makeup stay on longer. So I think that's everything I shared in my routine. If you have any more questions,

It's impressive how you've curated a detailed and effective beauty routine with a variety of products for different occasions. Your step-by-step explanation provides valuable insight into your makeup process. Is there any specific reason or inspiration behind the selection of these products?

참여자14:13

I think a lot of it has been by trial and error. I used to get a makeup subscription service a long time ago that helped me figure out what brands and what sorts of products I liked. And now I just kind of stick to the brands that I know and I like. Although, I am always willing to try new brands, especially Rhode is a newer brand that I've tried I will see a lot of products on social media that will make me curious, and maybe I'll go to Sephora and try the product there myself and see if there's any way it can benefit my routine or maybe I wanna switch it up. But there's certain products like the Hangover I've been using for years, and I know that there's a lot of good primers out there. But I've just been using that one for years, so I've never switched it out.
